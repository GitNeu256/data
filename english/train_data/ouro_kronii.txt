Profile
Revision
"Kroniichiwa! It's me, perfection. Also synonymous for Ouro Kronii!"
Time is an unwavering, precise entity, and its Warden - its overseer - is equally cool and impeccable.
Occasionally her exquisiteness leads her to decisions and bouts of luck that transcend the understanding of mere mortals. However, even utmost perfection finds no foothold in the face of her mortal enemy—disorder.
Original
A member of the Council and the Warden of "Time," the third concept birthed by the Gods and the one most intrinsically linked with mankind.
None may escape the sands of time and, indeed, most men do not even wish to be freed from her captivity. She picked up the blades almost as a reflex action of sorts, and seems to be enjoying it. Her quiet, aloof personality has never changed over the ages, but she has developed a little bit of haughtiness and sadistic tendencies along the way...
Originally, the concept of time was but a cog in the wheel, one which only functioned in tandem with others.
Eventually, humans went on to give time individual meanings such as dawn and dusk, making it universal. The humans became enslaved to Time in return for empowering her. In her present form, she has become a sadistic, prideful warden.
Personality
Ouro Kronii is very confident, self-centered, and completely unafraid to praise herself. However, she also describes herself as someone who is generally not a happy person, to the point of listing "existential dread" as a hobby. Kronii can be playful at times, especially with her Kronies, and the combination of her deadpan humor and dry delivery of jokes contrasts many of the other members who are either more outgoing or gentler with their words.
Her voice is powerful and well-controlled, giving off an "older sister" vibe, although her actual personality is a bit closer to a "cool aunt" or a painfully relatable comic relief character. Her projected confidence and self-praise can be interpreted as a coping mechanism for the constant suffering she endures, both due to her hilariously bad luck and the fact that others love to tease her so much.
Kronii is generally very self-conscious, meaning she actively looks out for her own mistakes - "that's on me" and "that was my bad" are phrases that she says often when playing. She vocalizes rather explosively whenever she takes damage or is killed in video games. While she has a deep voice comparable to Mori Calliope, she also has a wide vocal-range; she once produced a high-pitched voice by a viewer's request.
Ceres Fauna described Kronii as cool, funny, good at memes, and having a voice that she wants to read her to sleep every night. She described that Kronii has a substantial capacity for "gap moe," a cute side that comes out when she is flustered, in contrast to her normally cool nature. Despite her lore describing her as a haughty sadist, she has shown to be very accommodating to both her chat and her genmates.
Her narcissism can creep in at times, to the point that her advice to viewers is often jokingly to "just be better," though the dynamic with her chat is such that they have done just the same to her when she needs help in video games.
Hakos Baelz described Kronii as too talented, savage, and a "tsundere granny."
Appearance
She has short, dark blue hair and blue eyes. She has blue bow shaped earrings.
History
Background
Following the success of hololive English in 2020 and 2021, COVER Corporation announced auditions for a second batch of English members from 12 February to 26 March 2021. Twitter accounts for the five new members were created in June 2021 and YouTube accounts created on 26 July 2021.
Teaser videos for the new generation began on the official hololive English YouTube Channel in August 2021. On 1 August, "Prelude" revealed a story of gods creating the four concepts of space, nature, time, and civilization. On 14 August, "Omen" described the creation of avatars of those four concepts plus that of the primordial force of Chaos, revealing five silhouettes. On 17 August, "Council" revealed the five new hololive English members and announced a grand debut scheduled for the coming weekend. Although the traditional term "generation" was not officially used to refer to the new members, who had been referred to as "hololive English Generation 2" by fans, the new members nonetheless formed a group known as "-Council-".
Upon conclusion of the Council debut PV, all five new members' Twitter and YouTube accounts were revealed, and each made their first tweet. Twitter quickly restricted Kronii and Nanashi Mumei's accounts due to the sudden increase in followers.
On 17 August 2021, around 24 hours after the initial announcement, Ouro Kronii reached 100,000 YouTube subscribers before her debut. However, YouTube soon removed around half of this number, possibly due to the sudden subscriber growth on a channel with no videos yet, which may have triggered a YouTube anti-bot algorithm. Her subscriber count was cut down yet again after she reached 200,000 YouTube subscribers for the first time.
Debut
Ouro Kronii's debut was scheduled for Sunday, 22 August. However, the -Council- debuts were postponed for 24 hours due to unspecified technical issues, which members jokingly blamed on the "EN curse", a perceived tendency for hololive English members to suffer from unexpected technical problems. The debuts were rescheduled at the same time on Sunday 22 August (US/Europe time) or Monday 23 August (Japan time).
Kronii made her debut stream on Monday, 23 August 2021 at 5am JST (22 August 1PM PDT or 9PM BST). She was the third member of hololive -Council- to debut. Her debut reached a peak viewership of over 90,000 viewers, and she reached 115,000 YouTube subscribers by the start of the stream. In the stream Kronii teased a song and concluded the stream by singing Butterfly, the Japanese opening theme to the anime Digimon Adventure.

The ornaments on her right are two light blue flowers with a bunch of smaller white flowers falling to the side. The ornaments on her left are big white flowers that have two smaller orange flowers. Behind this ornament on the back of her head, there is a dark blue flower ornament. Her kimono is light blue. The whole kimono is decorated with patterns of stylized flowers in blue, white, orange, and red. There is also a pattern of leaves and and golden gears. The most prominent decoration is a big white snake with blue eyes, whose body decorates the cloth that Kronii calls Ouroboros. A second serpent with red eyes is coming out of the obi area, whose body is hidden by Kronii's fluffy scarf. Her kimono only covers her left leg, her right leg visible, but covered by a long, white sock. On her right hand, she holds a white fan stylized like clock hands that resemble Kronii's swords with a gear pattern between them. Kronii can open and close the fan. During this stream, Kronii also introduced a new mascot: a small white snake named "Boros."
On 25 January, Kronii posted a debut PV for holoMinistry, a hololive generation that seems to be the male versions of holoCouncil, on her own channel. The debut PV was made to be almost identical to the holoCouncil debut PV. The holoMinistry debut PV revealed the five "new" hololive English members: Tsukumo San, Ceres Faun, Ouro Krono, Nanashi Muman, and Hayko.

Trivia
Name
* The surname "Ouro" appears to derive from "ouroboros," an ancient Greek name for a circular symbol of a serpent eating its own tail, representing an endless cycle. "Ouro" specifically means "tail."
* The name "Kronii" appears to derive from the ancient Greek "chrono," meaning "time."
* Despite how it's officially written, Kronii reads her name in Western order: "Kronii Ouro," like Sana Tsukumo, Baelz Hakos, Calliope Mori, and Amelia Watson.
* Prior to debut, a rejected surname for Kronii was "Gandr," a reference to Jörmungandr, the serpent of Norse myth. Similar to Ouroborus, Jörmungandr is depicted as a giant serpent so large that it is able to surround the Earth and grasp its own tail. The name was changed at Kronii's request.
Lore
* Kronii's role as Warden of "Time" suggests a connection to fellow hololive English member Watson Amelia, a time traveler.
