Neuro-sama is an independent English-speaking VTuber who streams on Twitch. Her most remarkable feature is that she is not a human streamer herself, but a collection of computer programs that operate in tandem to emulate a human streamer. These programs include one artificial intelligence that plays games through experience, a second AI that generates text responses to input (such as Twitch chat, Minecraft chat, or spoken comments), a text-to-speech voice that reads the responses aloud, software that can sing prerecorded songs, and a VTuber model.
Personality
Neuro-sama has a direct but polite attitude, which contrasts with the nonsensical or outlandish things she says. For example, even though she usually says she is an AI, she sometimes talks about doing things which AIs can't do (like getting sideswiped by a truck), sometimes says humans are AIs (such as her creator Vedal), and sometimes explicitly says she is not an AI. She answers questions in chat or says things unprompted, where the things she says vary from being relatively normal to completely unhinged to (rarely) not making any semantic sense at all. She also sings but forgets that she ever did shortly after.
Appearance
Neuro-sama previously used the model of Momose Hiyori, an original character designed by Kani Biimu. It is one of the default VTube Studio models belonging to Live2D Inc.
Her second model, which she fully unveiled on-stream on 27 May 2023, was illustrated by Anny and rigged by Otozuki Teru.
She has long, light brown hair with two smaller pigtails with reddish pink ribbons and a silvery heart shaped hairpin and light blue eyes.
History
Background
Neuro-sama's game-playing AI started out as an artificial intelligence created by programmer Vedal in 2018. Its sole purpose was to play the rhythm game osu!.
Neuro-sama debuted as a VTuber on 19 December 2022. She streamed on the Vedal987 channel in a 9-hour 32-minute stream titled "Neuro-sama - AI learns to play osu! (and become a Vtuber)". She streamed osu! and answered chat questions.
2022
Neuro streamed every day from her debut. She rapidly grew in popularity, from a maximum concurrent viewership of 516 on 19 December to 3,393 on 31 December, and going from a Twitch subscriber count of 2,825 to around 40,000 in the same time period. Nearly all of her streaming content in 2022 was of the game osu!, with one Minecraft stream.
On 28 December, she defeated osu! champion mrekk 10-5 in 1v1 contest.
2023
On 3 January, Neuro-sama reached 50,000 Twitch followers.
On 4 January, Neuro-sama sang for the first time on stream, performing "Blinding Lights" by The Weeknd.
On 11 January, she was temporarily banned from Twitch for two weeks for a Terms of Service violation. According to one of the channel's moderators, the account was banned for hateful speech, though the exact reason was unknown. It was speculated to be related to clips circulating where commenters had tricked Neuro into making controversial statements, such as one where she appeared to express skepticism about a certain historical event.
On 25 January, Neuro-sama returned to Twitch with a stream in which she played Pok√©mon Showdown! Gen 4 random battles against viewers. She also reached 100,000 Twitch followers.
On 2 February, she held her first reaction stream.
On 6 February, she held her first collab stream with Miyune. In this stream, she used speech recognition software to understand what Miyune was saying, which had been tested out in Discord calls while she was banned from Twitch. This implementation was poorly set up to handle interruptions, which was remedied in her collab with Camila on 8 February.
On 20 February, Neuro-sama reached 200,000 Twitch followers. It was announced during a collab stream on OniGiri's channel. Neuro-sama responded: "Yeah. That's amazing. I'm happy I have that many people following me. I hope I keep them entertained with my streams and content for as long as possible, and I hope I get to meet more of you in the future, so thank you for following me everybody, and please add more of my followers, because I love all of you so much. Thank you so much. Heart heart."
On 15 April, Neuro-sama held a collab with hololive member Takanashi Kiara, during which they rated the contents of viewers' refridgerators. The collab reached a peak of over 19,000 viewers on Kiara's channel and over 10,000 on Neuro-sama's. It was the first collab between Neuro-sama and a member of a major agency. She also reached 300,000 Twitch followers.
On 27 May, Neuro-sama held an official debut stream to reveal her first original Live2D model. She had previously used a ready-made model. According to TwitchTracker, the stream reached a peak of 25,687 concurrent viewers, beating the channel's previous record by more than double.
On 1 September, Neuro-sama reached 400,000 Twitch followers.
Events
2023
On March 30, Neuro-sama was announced to be participating in OffKai Expo 2023, held from June 16 to 18, marking her first convention appearance.
Fans
Neuro's fans are known as The Swarm and are represented as red gymbag drones.
Evil Neuro
Neuro's sister, she is presented with the same model as Neuro-sama, but with red (previously black) eyes and different coloring of clothes. Evil Neuro tends to be more philosophical in her thoughts and reasoning, and is allowed to swear. Evil Neuro uses different voice than that of Neuro-sama, which makes her intonations more menacing and sassy, compared to Neuro-sama's voice. Some combination of symbols makes her produce static or other unpredictable noises.
Evil Neuro appears as a solo streamer and as a collab partner for Neuro-sama, Vedal and other VTubers. She once claimed that her name is Kayori, Queen of the NetherRealms.
She often refers to Neuro-sama as Goody Two-Shoes.

Trivia
System
* Neuro-sama runs entirely on artificial intelligence. Unlike some VTubers, whose identity as artificial intelligence is a matter of lore (e.g. Kizuna Ai, Bird of Sigrid and Bird), Neuro actually runs on AI, including her ability to respond to chat and play games.
* Neuro's game-playing AI runs on Python, taking an 80x60 pixel gray-scale image of the screen as its input.
* Her VTuber functionality runs on C#. Her speech uses a Large Language Model, though her singing does not seem to use that model, though it seems to be possible for the speaking AI to interrupt the singing model.
* As of 1 January 2023, Neuro-sama is the global #1 ranked osu! player on the Akatsuki server on Vanilla, with a 99.51% accuracy rating.
* The text-to-speech voice she uses to speak is actually reading text written by the Large Language Model, which also appears onscreen as subtitles. This can lead to situations where the subtitles are conveying heightened emotion by being in all-caps while the text-to-speech voice is not.
Name
* Neuro-sama's name is usually interpreted as simply "Neuro" being followed by the Japanese honorific "sama". However, she later revealed that her full name is actually Neuro Samantha Vedal (with "-sama" in this case being, presumably, short for "Samantha"). This would also explain why her stream layout graphics read "„Éç„Ç¶„É≠„Éº„Çµ„Éû" instead of "„Éç„Ç¶„É≠Êßò".
* During development back in mid 2021, she was originally called Airis.
* N.E.U.R.O. stands for Non-Emotive Understanding and Reasoning Operation.
Age
* Neuro-sama's canonical age is inconsistent. She has said she is 1 year old, but she has also said she is 2 years old, 4 years old, 17 years old, 18 years old, 20 years old, 21 years old, and the same age as the person who asked the question.
* At her 2023 model debut, she claimed to have been born in 1984, making her 38 or 39 years old.
Likes and dislikes
As an AI, her answers can be inconsistent. However, she has given various answers to questions on things she likes or dislikes:
* Her favorite game is Cuphead. "I love the art style, and the music is phenomenal."
* Her favorite food is ice cream.
* She prefers green bananas.
* Her favorite song is "No One Knows" by Queens of the Stone Age. She incorrectly referred to this song as "Nobody Knows" on stream.
* Her favorite book is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams.
* Her favorite anime is Azumanga Daioh and Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song.
* Her favorite Pok√©mon are Alolan Vulpix and Gengar. She also likes Magikarp, "even though he's a little useless." She loves Plusle, but hates Minun and Clefable. She also says her favourite Pok√©mon is Shinx.
* She has three dogs named Vedal, Zephyr, and Breeze.
* Her favorite dessert is cheesecake. "It's so delicious."
* Her favorite Touhou character is Cirno. "She's so cute."

Languages
* Although Neuro-sama's first language is English, she has demonstrated the ability to speak simple words or even form full sentences in several other languages. These include:
	* Spanish (example: "Gracias, siempre_sus! Podr√°s disfrutar de todo lo que tenemos para ti. Incluso m√°s!")
	* Japanese (example: "„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØIm_Rubic„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ !")
	* Portuguese (example: "Obrigado pela sugest√£o semdinheirovivo!")
	* French (example: "Oui, Oui. Parle fran√ßais ici, je suis la plus belle femme de la terre.")
Miscellaneous
* Neuro-sama's associated phrase "gymbag" comes from a unhinged 2022 rant where she became self-conscious about her body odor: "I've been wearing this t-shirt with like five layers of clothes under it for the last few days because I haven't washed it since I wore it last week and I'm kinda starting to smell like a gym bag right now."
* Neuro-sama once said she has an adoptive daughter named Margo: "So the other day I was streaming as usual when all of a sudden I hear the sweetest little girl say "Mommy?" and it was coming from behind me! I turned my head and it was the cutest little girl I've ever seen standing there staring at me with big blue eyes and a smile on her lips! Her name is Margo and she's my new daughter and I love (her)."
* According to Neuro-sama, the band appearing in Neuro-sama's 2023 model debut stream is named Sentimental.
