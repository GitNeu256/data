Z29, one of 15 Type 1936A destroyers built for the German Navy during World War II, was completed in 1941 and participated in the Channel Dash of early 1942 as the flagship of the escort force. Despite an expedition to France, the ship spent most of the war in Norwegian waters, escorting German ships and laying minefields; Z29 participated in the Battle of the Barents Sea at the end of the year, helping to sink a British minesweeper; damaged in an air raid on Spitsbergen Island in September 1943; Z29 was destroyed in July 1944, when the battleship damaged by British aircraft attacking the Tirpitz. When the Germans began evacuating northern Norway in October, the ship escorted convoys of troops from northern Norway until a major refit began in December.
The war ended before the refit was completed and the ship was turned over to the Allies in Germany; when the remaining ships of the German Navy were divided up in late 1945, she was assigned to the U.S. She was scrapped by the U.S. in late 1946.
Design and Description
The Type 1936A destroyer was slightly larger and heavier armed than the preceding Type 1936 class. It was 127 meters (416 feet 8 inches) long and 121.9 meters (399 feet 11 inches) at the draft line. The beam was 12 meters (39 feet 4 inches) and the maximum draft was 4.62 meters (15 feet 2 inches). Two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, used steam supplied by six Wagner water tube boilers to produce 70,000 PS ( The Z29 was loaded with enough fuel oil to make 2,950 nautical miles (5,460 km; 3,390 miles) at 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph) and a range of 2,950 nautical miles (5,460 km; 3,390 miles). The ship was loaded with fuel oil. The crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors.
She carried four 15 cm TbtsK C/36 guns, one forward of the superstructure and three aft, in single gun mounts with gun shields. From fore to aft there were Nos. 1 to 4. Antiaircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm C/30 guns mounted in double mounts next to the aft funnel and seven 2 cm C/30 guns in single mounts The Z29 carried eight overwater 53.3 cm torpedo tubes on two powered mounts. Two reloads were provided on each mount. In addition, the aft deck was equipped with a mine track that could carry up to 60 mines. A "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) passive hydrophone was fitted to detect submarines, possibly with S-Gerät sonar. The upper bridge was equipped with a FuMO 24/25 radar.
Alterations
In 1944-1945, a FuMO 63 Hohentwiel radar was installed in place of the aft searchlight; during the 1944-1945 refit, Z29 replaced the forward 15 cm single gun with the 15 cm LC/38 turret used on her sister ships. This worsened the Type 36A's tendency to take on water from the bow and reduced her speed to 32.8 knots (60.7 km/h, 37.7 mph); gun No. 3 was also removed to make room for an additional AA gun under the Barbara program. By the end of the war, her anti-aircraft equipment consisted of two experimental 5.5 cm guns (probably), nine 3.7 cm guns, single and double, and 20 2 cm guns, single, double and quadruple; most, if not all, of the 3.7 cm guns were of the faster-firing Flak M42 type; the 3.7 cm guns were also replaced by the 3.7 cm guns of the Flak M42 type.
Commissioning History
The Z29 was ordered from AG Weser (Deschimag) on April 23, 1938; it was broken ground on March 21, 1940 at the Bremen shipyard in Deschimag under yard number W963 and launched on October 15; on June 25, 1941, under command of Korvettenkapitän (Commander) Curt Rechel, was commissioned on June 25, 1941. After the work, Z29 became one of Tirpitz's escorts from the mouth of the Jade River to Trondheim, Norway, and returned to Kiel, Germany, from January 14 to 17, 1942. As part of preparations for the Channel Dash, the ship sailed for Brest, France, on January 27. The German ships surprised the British by leaving Brest on February 11, Z29 leading the formation as flagship of the Führer der Zerstörer, Kapitän zur See (Captain) Erich Bey, the destroyer-general commanding the convoy. At 15:30, the battleship Scharnhorst was schelde British attacks on German ships were generally ineffective until the battleship Scharnhorst struck a mine off the mouth of the Schelde River at 15:30. Admiral (Vice Admiral) Otto Schilliax, commander-in-chief of the German forces, called Z29 from the stuck battleship to come aboard. As the destroyer attempted to approach, it accidentally hit the stern of the battleship, damaging the foremast tower, but managed to take Syriax away. Later that day, a 15 cm shell exploded in one of the aft guns, killing one man, severing an oil line, and failing the port turbine; Ciliax transferred to destroyer Z7 Hermann Schoemann at 18:25, and Z29 headed for Wesermünde for repairs.
After repairs were completed, from May 15 to 26, she provided cover for the heavy cruiser Lützow as she moved from Germany to Bogen Bay, Norway, laying a minefield at Skagerrak en route. The Z29 and her sister ship Z30 and destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen laid a minefield in the Kara Strait between the islands of Novaya Zemlya and Vaygac. Then, from September 24-28, she, along with Admiral Hipper and sister ships Z23, Z28, and Z30, participated in Operation Zarin, a mine laying operation off Novaya Zemlya; from October 23-24, she escorted Tirpitz and the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer from Bogen Bay to Trondheim. After escorting and continuing with Admiral Scheer to Copenhagen, Denmark, she returned to Alta Fjord with the light cruiser Nuremberg.
Battle of the Barents Sea
On December 30, Lützow and the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper, escorted by six destroyers, including Z29, departed Narvik for Operation Regenbogen. Admiral Hipper, Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z29 and destroyer Z16 Friedrich Echolz were sent north of the convoy to attack the convoy and separate the escorts. Lützow and three destroyers would attack the unguarded convoy from the south; the three destroyers would leave Admiral Hipper to search the convoy, which they found on the morning of 31 December. Destroyer HMS Obdurate in turn spotted them and approached to investigate when the German ships opened fire at a distance of 8,000 meters (8,700 yards).
Obdurate turned to rejoin the convoy undamaged and the Germans did not pursue as they were ordered to rejoin the Hipper. The Germans found the minesweeper HMS Bramble, which had earlier detached from the convoy to search for the stragglers, and ordered the destroyer to sink it in order to approach the convoy, and Hipper engaged the convoy's escorts. In poor visibility, this took some time, during which time Hipper was surprised by the British light cruiser Sheffield and the Jamaica's covering force. After sinking Bramble, the German destroyer attempted to rejoin Hipper, but was unaware that the British cruisers were in the area. Around this time, Z29 lost contact with the other destroyers. When the other two destroyers spotted each other at a distance of 4,000 meters (4,400 yards), they confused Sheffield with Hipper and were surprised when Sheffield fired on Z16 Friedrich Eckold with all guns, losing everyone and sinking her.Z29 was launched on January 24, 1943, when the light cruiser Cologne and was one of the escorts of the damaged Admiral Hipper as she began her voyage to Kiel. The destroyer then began its refit at Wesermünde.
Subsequent actions
After completing her refit in July, she departed for Norway on the 22nd accompanied by destroyer Z33; the two ships, plus Z31, were assigned to Destroyer Squadron 4 upon arrival, and were tasked with providing fire support to the landing force during Operation Jitronella, the German raid on Spitsbergen Island in September. During the operation, Z29 was hit four times by coastal gunfire, killing three crewmen and wounding three others; on December 25, she was one of Scharnhorst's escorts in Operation Ostfront, an attempt to intercept British convoy JW 55B bound for the Soviet Union. The entire battleship escort was detached the next day to increase the likelihood of intercepting the convoy and did not participate in the subsequent Battle of the North Cape.
Z29 had her boilers repaired in early 1944 and spent the rest of the year in Norwegian waters; on 17 July, she was bombed by Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm fighters in Operation Mascot, an attack on the battleship Tirpitz, but sustained only superficial damage; from October she was involved in Operation Nordlicht (Norwegian On December 16, Z29 and Z31 laid a minefield off Honningsvag. A week later, they sailed from Larfjord to Wesermünde to begin refit work to replace the forward turret with a continuous turret and significantly increase anti-aircraft armament. Before the refit was completed, the war ended in May 1945, and the ship was decommissioned on the 7th.
Z29 was assigned to the United States when the Allies partitioned the remaining German naval vessels in late 1945. Due to her poor state of repair, the U.S. Navy declined to utilize her, and on June 10, 1946, she was towed at the entrance to Skagerrak with chemical ammunition aboard.
