The T-90 is Russia's third-generation main battle tank, developed as the successor to the T-72, featuring a 125 mm 2A46 smoothbore main gun, 1A45T fire control system, improved engine, and gunner's thermal sight. Standard protection measures include mixed steel and composite armor, smoke grenade dischargers, Contact 5 Explosive Reaction Armor (ERA), and the Stora infrared anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) jamming system.
The T-90 was designed and manufactured by the Uralvagonzavod company in Nizhny Tagil, Russia; it was deployed to the Russian Army in 1992.
Development
The T-90's origins lie in a Soviet-era program aimed at developing a successor to the T-64, T-72, and T-80 series main battle tanks (MBTs) The T-72 platform was chosen as the basis for the new generation of tanks because of its cost-effectiveness, simplicity, and automotive quality. The Kartsev Venediktov Design Bureau in Nizhny Tagil was responsible for the design work, which included Object 188, a relatively simple upgrade of the existing T-72B tank (Object 184) and vaguely related to the T-72 series, with significant improvements in body and turret design, armor, power units and armament Two proposals were prepared in parallel: the much more advanced Object 187, vaguely related to the T-72 series and incorporating significant improvements in body and turret design, armor, powerplant, and armament. Development work was approved in 1986 and the first prototype was completed by 1988. Object 188 was designed by a team led by V.N. Venediktov. The biggest change was the integration of the T-80U's 1A45 fire control system. Object 188 was initially designated as the T-72BM. The first four aircraft were delivered for testing in January 1989. A modified version (called the T-72BU) was delivered beginning in June 1990; in March 1991, the Soviet Ministry of Defense recommended that the Army adopt the Object 188. Development of the Object 187 was discontinued at the same time for unknown reasons.
History of Production and Commissioning
Russian tank production declined in the years before and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Kharkov tank factory belonged to the newly independent Ukraine, the Chelyabinsk tractor factory ceased production in 1989, and Kirov in Leningrad in 1990. The two remaining tank factories in Omsk and Nizhny Tagil received almost no more orders from the state in 1992 In the 1980s, the Soviet Army ordered the T-64, T-72, and T-80, which at the time were produced simultaneously by rival tank design companies In the 1980s, the Soviet Army ordered the T-64, T-72, T 80 tanks on order; all three tanks had similar characteristics, but each required different parts, which placed a logistical burden on the Army. The Nizhny Tagil's T-90 and Omsk's T-80U each had their advantages, but the T-80's gas turbine engine was notorious for its high fuel consumption and poor reliability. Moreover, the Russian T-80 suffered heavy losses in its first battle in the First Chechen War, and in January 1996, Colonel Aleksandr Galkin, head of the Russian Defense Ministry's Main Armor Directorate, stated that the Russian military would phase out production of the T-80 and adopt the T-90 (Galkin reversed his position later that year, and the T-80U The T-90's main improvements were a slightly modified version of the T-80U's more sophisticated 1A45T Irtysh fire control system and the incorporation of an improved V-84MS multi-fuel engine producing 840 hp (618 kW). The T-90 was produced at the Uralvagonzavod plant in Nizhny Tagil, with low-level production beginning in 1992, but production for the home market was virtually discontinued at the end of the 1990s. Approximately 120 T-90 tanks were delivered to the Russian Ground Forces until production of improved versions resumed in 2004; by September 1995, approximately 107 T-90 tanks had been produced in the Siberian Military District. Later, according to another U.S. report, "By mid-1998, only 150 vehicles had been produced, but the 21st Motor Rifle Division of the Siberian Military District received these MBTs and formed a tank regiment (T-90s were also deployed in the 5th Don Guard Tank Division in Buryat Province)." However, the MRD 21st Division had already been downgraded to a mobile rifle brigade by this point and was reduced to a storage base in 1997.
Faced with declining domestic orders, Uralvagonzavod obtained government permission to export the T-90 in the mid-1990s. Around the same time, Uralvagonzavod designers developed a new welded turret with improved protection and internal space, and in 1997, India showed interest in the T-90 after Pakistan purchased 320 Ukrainian T-80UD tanks. The heavy vehicle plant in Avadi, India, was already producing T-72s under license under the name "Ajeya"; the first 42 complete vehicles were delivered in 2001 and designated T-90S (Object 188S). They were still equipped with the old cast turret of the initial series (thus using up the remaining stock of cast turrets stored at Nizhny Tagil) and were powered by a V-84 engine producing 840 hp (618 kW). In 2002, 82 cars with a new welded turret and a V-92S2 producing 1,000 hp (735 kW) engine, 82 vehicles were delivered. According to the original contract, the next 186 tanks (now officially called Bhishma) were to be completed in India from kits supplied by Russia and gradually replaced with domestically produced components. Delays in domestic production forced the Indian authorities to order an additional 127 complete vehicles from Uralvagonzavod.
In 2005, the Russian military resumed deliveries of T-90s and requested "original" specification vehicles with cast turrets. In 2005, 18 new tanks were delivered, equivalent to about five tank platoons. These new tanks were powered by V-92S2 engines, equipped with T01-K05 Buran-M gunner sights (passive and active night vision channels with EPM-59G Mirage-K matrix, maximum observation range 1,800 m), and the latest Kontakt-5 with 4S22 explosive tiles It was protected by reactive armor.
In 2006-2007, 31 T-90A tanks each equipped with fully passive ESSA main gun sights and improved 4S23 ERA tiles were delivered, supplied by Peleng of Belarus and using Thales' second-generation Catherine-FC thermal imaging cameras JSC A joint venture based on "Volzhsky Optical and Mechanical Plant" (VOMZ) and Thales Optronics was established to produce the Catherine-FC thermal imaging camera and export versions of the T-72B3 tanks and T-90S (India, Since 2012, Russia has been able to produce the third generation of Catherine-XP cameras based on QWIP matrix technology. In 2012, the Russian-made T01-K04DT/Agat-MDT command-coupled sample surveillance sighting system was presented to the public at the International Forum Engineering Technology 2012. According to the Krasnogorsky Zavod plant, Agat-MDT has the capability (for further modernization) to mount the newly developed domestic UPF format 640 x 512 x 15 microns on its sights, which in the future will extend the nighttime target identification range to 3.5-4.0 km without sight modifications In the future, it will be possible to extend the nighttime target identification range to 3.5 to 4.0 km without modification of the sights. In 2016, the Krasnogorsk plant completed testing of Irbis-K night vision devices for the T-80U and T-90, with first deliveries scheduled for 2017. The completion of Irbis-K, the first mercury-cadmium telluride (MCT) matrix thermal sight produced in Russia, addressed a shortcoming of Russian tanks compared to their Western counterparts: in 2007, some 334 T-90s of various types were deployed in the Russian Army's 5th Guards Tank Division stationed in the Siberian Military District tanks were deployed and seven T-90 tanks were deployed in the Marine Corps; since 2008, the Russian Army has received 62 tanks each year and stopped placing orders in 2011.
After the cancellation of the T-95 in 2010, Uralvagonzavod initiated the OKR Armata (armament) design study. The result of this study was the Object 148 (itself based on the Object 187), which was based on the T-95. The Russian Army has curtailed T-90 orders since 2012 to prepare for the arrival of new tanks; in July 2021, Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said that the tank, named T-14 Armata, would go into series production in 2022. a modified version of the T-90M tank will enter service in April 2020 in the Russian Federation Deliveries to the Guards Tank Army of the Western Military District began in April 2020.The T-90M "Proryov" ("breakthrough") is equipped primarily with a new turret, a 2A46M-5 gun, and a more powerful engine.Proryv is equipped with a new multi-channel targeting system that allows the weapon to be used day and night and to exchange data with other vehicles and exchange data in real time. The new batch was delivered in March 2021. According to Ukrainian sources, international sanctions have delayed T-90 production since the invasion of Ukraine began, and an article in Forbes magazine in early October 2023 suggested that increased T-90 losses in Ukraine would lead to increased production of the T-90M.
For Combat
Use in Russia
An early version of the export-oriented T-90S, instead of being delivered to India, is believed to have seen combat action during the Chechen invasion of Dagestan in 1999. The tank's survivability against rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) is disputed. Gordon L. Rotman writes that the T-90 was "frequently" knocked out by three or four RPG-7 hits. The Chechens, he adds, found ways to endanger the T-90s, which were equipped with explosive-reactive armor. They fire RPG-7s at close range (within 50 meters) to activate the explosive-reactive armor protection, then re-attack with two or more RPGs under the exposed tank armor, again at close range.The T-90A was deployed to Syria in 2015 to support Russian entry into the Syrian civil war. In September 2020, a Russian T-90 was accidentally hit by an anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) during an exercise in Russia's Astrakhan region, severely damaging the vehicle.
The Russo-Ukrainian War and Russia's Full-Scale Invasion of Ukraine
During the Donbass War phase of the Russo-Ukrainian War in the summer of 2014, elements of the Russian 136th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade equipped with T-90A tanks operating in Ukraine's Luhansk Oblast were identified in social media posts and their photo locations were located by open source investigators By May 12, T-90s were reportedly destroyed in Kharkov by Swedish Carl Gustav man-portable anti-tank grenades in Russia's full invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. As of January 14, 2024, the Oryx Blog recorded (visually confirmed) that Russia had lost at least 100 T-90s since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These include 36 T-90A (23 of which were destroyed, 1 damaged, 2 abandoned, and 10 captured), 1 T-90AK (1 captured), 7 T-90S (6 destroyed, 1 abandoned), and 57 T-90M (32 destroyed, 10 damaged, 12 abandoned, and 3 captured). During this conflict, the T-90s faced many types of anti-tank missiles, including modern "top attack" missiles such as the U.S.-made FGM-148 Javelin and the British-Swedish NLAW. These types of missiles are known to be capable of destroying these tanks. Russia developed the "Arena" active protection system designed to protect tanks from anti-tank weapons, anti-tank guided missiles, and missiles with Top Attack warheads.In January 2024, in a battle near Stepove, Bradley Fighting Vehicles of the Ukrainian 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade (BFV) two tanks engaged the T-90M. The tanks were outflanked and damaged by the BFVs. The crew escaped before the FPV drones destroyed the tanks.
Syrian Army.
In early February 2016, the Syrian Army began using T-90As in combat. A video was leaked on the Internet showing a T-90 in Aleppo surviving a direct turret-front hit by a TOW missile; the reactive armor of the Kontakt-5 bounced off the TOW warhead before it impacted. Two T-90s operated by the Syrian army were captured by HTS militias, and ISIS fighters captured a third in November 2017. The rebel-operated T-90 was recaptured by Syrian government forces, while the second was reportedly destroyed during the fighting by T-72. In addition, according to recorded documents, five T-90 tanks operated by the Syrian army were either knocked out or heavily damaged, while four others were hit.
Azerbaijan.
Azerbaijan used T-90S tanks in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict; one T-90 was damaged and captured by Armenian forces. At least two are confirmed to have been destroyed in the early stages of the war, making this the first time in history that this combat vehicle has proven to be a total loss. Export
INDIA.
In 2001, India purchased 310 T-90S tanks from Russia. The T-90s were selected because they were a direct development of the T-72s already manufactured by India, simplifying training and maintenance. To counter the Ukrainian T-80 tanks deployed by Pakistan between 1995 and 1997, India chose to introduce the T-90s. These T-90S tanks were manufactured by Uralvagonzavod, and their engines were supplied by the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant. However, the Indian tanks are not equipped with the Shtora-1 passive electronic countermeasure system, which is considered outdated.
In October 2006, an additional US$800 million contract was signed for 330 T-90S "Bhishma" MBTs to be built in India.
The T-90S Bhishma (named after the guardian warrior in the Mahabharata) is a modified version of the T-90S for India and was developed with Russian and French assistance. The tank was equipped with Catherine-FC thermal sights manufactured by Thales of France. The tanks use Russian Contact 5 explosive reactive armor in addition to main armor consisting of laminates and ceramic layers with high tensile properties.In 2021, the Indian Army is updating its T-90 tank fleet to a modern standard with both soft and hard kill systems, locally manufactured It was considering upgrading the T-90 tank fleet with modular active protection, and in December 2007, a third contract worth $1.23 billion was awarded for 347 upgraded T-90M vehicles (mostly produced under license by the HVF). The Army wanted to field a force of at least 21 regiments of T-90 tanks and 40 regiments of the upgraded T-72 tanks. In late 2009, the Indian Army began receiving its first T-90M main battle tanks from the Uralvagonzavod JSC, based in Nizhny Tagil, Russia, in fully knocked-down condition. The T-90M was equipped with a "Kaktus K-6" bolted explosive reactive armor (ERA) package on the front hull and turret top (the T-90S was equipped with "Kontakt-5" ERA), an enhanced environmental control system supplied by Kinetics Ltd of Israel to provide cooling air to the combat compartment and additional internal volume to accommodate cryogenic cooling systems for new generation infrared imagers such as the Catherine-FC infrared imager (operating at 8-12 micrometer bandwidth) manufactured by THALES. India plans to have 2,080 T-90 tanks in service by 2020.
The first batch of 10 license-produced T-90M vehicles was inducted into the Indian Army in August 2009. These vehicles were manufactured at the Heavy Vehicle Plant in Avadi, Tamil Nadu, and in 2012, the purchase of 354 new T-90SM tanks at a cost of ₹10,000 crore (US$1.3 billion) for six tank regiments for the Chinese border was approved, bringing the Indian Army's total number of T-90 tanks to 2011 reached a total of nearly 4,500 tanks in service (T-90 and its derivatives, T-72, and Arjun MBT), making India the world's third-largest tank owning country.
India planned to have 21 regiments of T-90 tanks by 2020, with 45 combat tanks and 17 training and replacement tanks per regiment; in November 2019, India announced that its heavy vehicle plant would produce 464 T-90S MBTs.
Other.
In 2005, deliveries of 185 initial order tanks for Algeria began. These are known as T-90SA ("A" stands for Algeria).
In January 2009, the Cyprus House of Representatives Defense Committee approved funding for the purchase of 41 Russian-made T-90 tanks. The funds were included as part of the 2009 defense budget. Cyprus already operates Russian-made T-80 tanks; in March 2010, it was reported that Cyprus had opted to purchase 41 additional T-80s instead of T-90s. According to an October 2008 article by analyst Jack Sweeney, Venezuelan defense sources said that President Hugo Chavez "wants to replace the military's obsolete AMX-30 main battle tanks with 50 to 100 Russian-made T-90 main battle tanks." in September 2009, a contract for only 92 T-72 tanks was announced. Saudi Arabia was reported in July 2008 by the Russian daily newspaper Kommersant to be in negotiations to purchase 150 T-90 tanks. Lebanese Defense Minister Elias El-Mul met with Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov in December 2008 to discuss a possible arms transfer involving T-90 tanks; an arms deal was signed between Libya and Russia in February 2010. Details of the sale were not immediately made public, but a Russian diplomat said that Libya wanted 20 fighter jets and air defense systems and might also be interested in purchasing "dozens" of T-90s and modernizing its fleet of 140 T-72s. However, after Libya cracked down on anti-government protesters in early 2011, the UN imposed an international arms embargo on Libya, which resulted in the suspension of the Russian arms deal. Peru was seeking to acquire 120-170 tanks to replace its aging T-55 tanks; the T-90s were tested against the U.S. M1A1 Abrams, Spanish Army's Leopard 2A4, Dutch Army's Leopard 2A6, and Ukraine's T-64 and T-84; by September 2013 the T-90S, Russian T-80, Ukrainian T-84, and U.S. M1A1 were the only ones still competing. Vietnam and Iraq signed a contract for at least 150 T-90S/SK tanks in 2016.
Design.
Armament.
The main armament of the T-90 is the 2A46M 125mm smoothbore gun. This is a highly modified version of the Sprat anti-tank gun, the same gun used as the main armament of the T-80 series tanks. It is interchangeable without dismantling the turret interior and can fire armor-piercing fin stabilized disposal sabots (APFSDS), high explosive anti-tank rounds (HEAT-FS), high explosive fragmentation rounds (HE-FRAG), and 9M119M Refleks anti-tank guided rounds.Refleks are semi-automatic line-of-sight guided (SACLOS) laser beam and a tandem-molded HEAT warhead. Effective range is 100 m to 6 km, and it takes 17.5 seconds to reach maximum range; the NSV's 12.7 mm (12.7 x 108) remotely operated anti-aircraft heavy machine gun, which can be operated by the commander from inside the tank, has a range of 2 km, 300 rounds available and a cycle firing rate of 700 to 800 rounds per minute (NSV, 1990s) The PKMT 7.62mm (7.62×54mmR) coaxial machine gun weighs approximately 10.5 kg, with 250 rounds in the ammunition box (2,000 rounds carried), adding another 9.5 kg to its weight. Like other modern Russian tanks, the T-90's 2A46M is fed by an autoloader, eliminating the need for a manual loader in the tank and reducing the crew to three (captain, gunner, driver). The autoloader can load 22 rounds of ready-to-fire ammunition onto the carousel and can load a round in 5 to 8 seconds. It has been suggested that the autoloaders of modern T-90 tanks have been modified to utilize newer ammunition such as the 3BM-44M APFSDS. HEAT rounds that can be fired from the 2A46M include the 3BK21B (with depleted uranium liner), 3BK29 (800mm RHA equivalent penetration), 3BK 29M (with a triple tandem charge warhead). In addition, the T-90 is equipped with an eye-net fuse setting system that allows the 3OF26 HE-FRAG round to detonate at a specific distance from the tank, as determined by the gunner's laser rangefinder, improving performance against helicopters and infantry. the HE-FRAG-FS has an accurate range of 10 km, while the APFSDS has a range of 4 km.The T-90's fire control system demonstrated the following characteristics of combat fire during national testing A moving T-90 tank (maximum speed 30 km/h) hit a heavily armored target at a range of up to 5 km with a high probability of hitting the target on the first shot. In the national test, 24 missiles with a range of 4 to 5 km were fired, all hitting their targets (all missile launches were performed by inexperienced experts.) The T-90 fire control system includes the PNK-4S/SR AGAT day/night sighting system mounted at the commander's station, with sight versions Early T-90s were equipped with TO1-KO1 BURAN sights, while later models (T-90S) were upgraded to ESSA infrared sights, and the use of the CATHERINE-FC thermal imaging camera manufactured by Thales Optronik, allows for nighttime detection of tank-sized targets in the range of 700 to 1100 meters. The use of this system made it possible to fire accurately at a range of 5,000 to 8,000 meters during the day and 3,300 meters at night. The gunner is also equipped with a 1G46 daysight system, including a laser rangefinder and missile guidance channel, to detect and engage tank-sized targets at 5 to 8 kilometers (3.1 to 5.0 miles). Drivers use TVN-5 day/night sights.In 2010, Russia began licensed production of Thales-developed Catherine FC thermal cameras for T-90M tanks, a Russian daily reported. These thermal imaging cameras are also installed on the T-90M "Bhishma" produced under license in India. In 2012, a combined sample of the Russian-made T01-K04DT/Agat-MDT commander surveillance sighting system was released. According to Krasnogorskiy Zavod (factory), Agat-MDT has the ability to be attached to newly developed (for further modernization) domestic UPF format 640 x 512 x 15 micron sights, and in the future the nighttime target identification range of 3.5-4.0 km without sight modification In 2016, the Krasnogorsk plant completed testing of the Irbis-K night vision gunnery sighting system for the T-80U and T-90, with first deliveries scheduled for 2018. The completion of Irbis-K, the first mercury-cadmium-tellurium (MCT) matrix thermal sight produced in Russia, will bridge the gap with major NATO countries in this field. The Russian-made thermal imaging device will not only eliminate the need to equip Russian tanks with foreign components, but will also mean that complete modernization of tanks will become cheaper. Furthermore, the demand for the T-72 and T-90 will not decrease in the coming years: upgraded versions of the T-72, T-80, and T-90 (T-72B3M, T-80BVM, and T-90M.) will replace the Thales Catherine-FC thermal imaging camera with the new thermal vision sights for tank gunners Irbis-K and the Agat-MDT combined sighting and observation system for the vehicle commander can be supplied.
Mobility.
The prime mover is the V-92S diesel engine, manufactured at the Chelyabinsk tractor plant; early T-90 tank models were equipped with a V-84MS 618 kW (840 hp) 4-stroke V-12 piston engine, an upgraded Uralvagonzavod 1,000 hp ( The T-90S with the 1,000 hp (750 kW) engine can reach speeds of up to 60 km/h (62 mph) on ordinary roads and 45 km/h (45 mph) on rough terrain. The T-90 tanks have a typical drivetrain arrangement with the engine and transmission located at the rear: the 1,000 hp (750 kW) engine is a V-92 4-stroke 12-cylinder multi-fuel diesel and the 1,250 hp (930 kW) engine is a V-96. The export version of the T-90, the modified T-90S, is equipped with a multi-fuel 1,000 hp (750 kW) diesel engine with a turbocharger and increased power output. The tanks are equipped with an air conditioning system for working in hot locations.
PROTECTION
The T-90's protection system consists of "three layers". The first layer is the composite armor of the turret, consisting of a basic armor shell made of alternating layers of aluminum and plastic and controlled deformation sections. The second layer is the third generation Contact 5 Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) bricks, which reduce the penetration of kinetic energy APFSDS munitions. These bricks give the turret its characteristic angled "shell" appearance; ERA bricks are also placed on the turret roof to defend against attacks from above. In addition to ERA and steel plates, the turret's front armor package includes Russian composite armor sandwiched between the upper and lower steel plates. The composite armor is lighter and more protective than the steel plate-only armor. The third layer is the Shtora-1 (Russian: Штора-1, "curtain" in English) countermeasure suite manufactured by Electromasina of Russia. The system includes two electro-optical/infrared "dazzlers" (i.e., active infrared jammers) on the front of the turret (giving it the characteristic "red eye"), four laser warning receivers, two 3D6 "smoke" grenade firing systems, and a computer control system. Shtora-1 is a system that allows tanks to alerts the crew when it is "painted" by a weapons-guided laser, allowing the crew to turn the turret around to confront the threat. The infrared jammer TShU1-7 EOCMDAS interferes with the semi-automatic line-of-sight guidance system (SACLOS) used by some anti-tank guided missiles. Smoke grenades are automatically fired when they detect that the strafing is painted. Smoke grenades are used to conceal tanks from the optics of laser rangefinders, detectors, and other weapons systems. Indian T-90S tanks are not equipped with the Stra 1 countermeasure suite; T-90S tanks will be equipped with the LEDS-150 land-based electronic defense system.
In addition to passive and active defense systems, the T-90 is also equipped with nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) defense equipment, a KMT mine sweeper, and an automatic fire suppression system. the T-90 can also be equipped with the EMT-7 electromagnetic anti-mine system. the EMT-7 fires an electromagnetic pulse to disable magnetic landmines and destroy electronics before the tanks reach the mine. The EMT-7 disables magnetic mines and destroys electronics before the tank reaches the mine. The Nakidka signature reduction suite can also be mounted on the T-90. the Nakidka is designed to reduce the probability of an object being detected by infrared, heat, radar heat, and radar bandwidth. in tests reportedly conducted by the Russian military in 1999, the T-90 was T-90s equipped with Kontakt-5 ERAs were not penetrated by any of the APFSDS or ATGMs used during the tests, outperforming the T-80U, which also participated. During combat operations in Dagestan, one T-90 was seen by eyewitnesses to remain in action despite being hit by seven rounds from RPGs; the T-90M and T-90MS were equipped with the more advanced "Relict" ERA. Relict protects against tandem warheads and reduces the penetration of APFSDS rounds by 50% or more; it can be mounted in place of Kontakt-1 or Kontakt-5.
Estimated Protection Level Comparison
The T-90A / T-90S turret uses a stronger steel alloy, which increases the level of protection afforded by the steel elements of the armor array by approximately 10-15%. Against tandem HEAT and pre-cursor-tipped penetrators, the protection value is somewhat reduced. These measures are not as effective against heavier, newer generations of E.R.A., such as Relict.
The actual level of protection offered by the T-90 was questioned after some of these models were destroyed or captured during the Russo-Ukrainian War.
Variations.
T-90 (Object 188) - first production model. Object 188 (1989), production 1992. Designated as T-72BU for a period during development; 46 tons; T-90K - commander's version of the T-90, with additional communications equipment (R-163-50K station) and navigation equipment (TNA-4-3).
T-90A - Russian military version with welded turret, V-92S2 engine, and ESSA thermal viewer. Sometimes called T-90 Vladimir after its chief designer, Vladimir Potkin.
T-90AK - Command version of the T-90A.
T-90AM ("Proryv-2") - Improved version of the T-90A, later developed into the T-90MS, featuring a new turret developed under the "Proryv-2" program. 48 tons. Not commissioned.
T-90M ("Proryv-3") - a significantly improved version of the T-90, first unveiled in 2017. Main features are: modernized turret design ("all-welded" instead of cast), new advanced fire control system Kalina (Integrated Combat Information and Control System), new Irbis-K gunner's sight and four video cameras providing 360° vision for the commander, new upgraded gun 2A46 with coaxial machine gun 7.62 mm M-5, and a Weapon Station "UDP T05BV-1" equipped with a 12.7 mm "Kord" remotely operated machine gun. The ammunition carousel has improved armor. Each side of the hull is equipped with additional armor plates in the front and slat armor in the rear. The new version is also equipped with a brand new Relict ERA on the turret and hull, a (now obsolete) jammer-free "soft kill" APS Stra-1 and a "hard kill" APS Arena-M. The ERA on the front of the turret is "cast" and can be easily replaced by the crew in the field. Other improvements include a new 1130 hp V-92S2F engine combined with an automatic transmission, an enhanced environmental control system, and a GLONASS satellite navigation system. It also has an upgraded autoloader, the AZ-185M2, which can use longer (and thus more effective) APFSDS ammunition Svinets-1 and Svinets-2. Much of the ammunition stored outside the autoloader has been moved from around the hull to the rear of the turret, where additional blowout panels protect the crew and other critical equipment, in case of a catastrophic munitions explosion.
T-90S - An export version of the T-90, later adopted by the Russian military as the T-90A. These tanks were manufactured by Uralvagonzavod and were updated with a 1,000 hp (750 kW) engine from the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant.
