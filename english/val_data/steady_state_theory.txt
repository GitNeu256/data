Steady-state theory is a cosmological model that proposes that the universe is always expanding but maintaining a constant average density. This means that new matter is continuously being created to fill in the space created by the expansion.
The steady-state theory was first proposed by Fred Hoyle, Thomas Gold, and Hermann Bondi in 1948. It was a direct challenge to the Big Bang theory, which had been proposed by Georges Lema√Ætre in 1931.
The steady-state theory was based on two main assumptions:
* The universe is infinite in extent and has no boundaries.
* The universe is homogeneous, meaning that it has the same properties everywhere.
The steady-state theory predicted that the universe would have a uniform background radiation, and that the redshift of distant galaxies would be constant.
In the 1960s, observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) provided strong evidence in favor of the Big Bang theory. The CMB is a faint afterglow of the initial explosion that created the universe.
Observations of the CMB showed that the universe is not infinite in extent, but has a finite size. This was a major blow to the steady-state theory.
In the 1970s, observations of distant galaxies showed that the redshift of these galaxies was not constant, but was increasing with distance. This was another major blow to the steady-state theory.
Today, the steady-state theory is no longer a viable cosmological model. The Big Bang theory is the prevailing model of cosmology, and is supported by a wide range of observational evidence.
The steady-state theory was a bold and innovative cosmological model, but it was ultimately disproven by observational evidence. The Big Bang theory, on the other hand, is supported by a wide range of evidence and is the prevailing model of cosmology today.
