In cosmology, the steady-state theory is a model proposed by Fred Hoyle and Thomas Gold in 1949 as an alternative to the Big Bang theory. In the late 1960s, however, the number of supporters declined significantly, and today it is considered a nonstandard cosmology. It is also the basis for another theory known as quasi-stationary theory. Quasi-stationary theory assumes that many small big bangs occur over time.
Steady state theory was developed as a result of theoretical calculations that there cannot be a static universe under general relativity and observations by Edwin Hubble that the universe is expanding. The Steady State Theory asserts that the universe is expanding, but still does not change its shape over time. For this theory to hold, new matter must be formed to maintain an equal density over time.
Since very little matter is formed, only about a few hundred hydrogen atoms are formed each year in the Milky Way galaxy, the fact that matter formation is not directly observed is not a problem for the theory. Despite its violation of the conservation of mass, the steady-state theory had many attractive features. Most notably, the theory eliminated the need for the universe to have a beginning.
Quasars and radio galaxies were found only at the far distance (i.e., in the past due to redshifts, i.e., the finite speed of light) and not in nearby galaxies. Halton Arp (Halton Arp) has also held a different view of this data since the 1960s, arguing that there is evidence for the existence of quasars even near the local Virgo cluster of galaxies.
For most cosmologists, the refutation of the steady-state theory is due to the discovery in 1965 of the cosmic background radiation predicted by the Big Bang theory. The Steady State Theory states that this background radiation is the result of light from ancient stars being scattered by galactic dust. However, this explanation has not been satisfactory to most cosmologists because the cosmic microwave background radiation is so smooth that it is difficult to explain how it originated from a point source, and the microwave background radiation does not exhibit features such as polarization that are usually associated with scattering. Furthermore, its spectrum is so close to that of an ideal blackbody that it is unlikely to be formed by the superposition of contributions from dust masses at different temperatures and redshifts.
As of 2005, the Big Bang theory is considered by the majority of astronomers to be the best approximation to explain the origin of the universe. In most astrophysical publications, the Big Bang is implicitly accepted and used as the basis for a more complete theory. On the other hand, after the unexpected observations of an accelerating universe in the late 1990s, there was a push to develop a quasi-steady state theory.
