The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), also known as the Soviet Union, was a socialist state that existed from 1922 to 1991. It was the largest country in the world by area, and the second-largest by population. The capital of the USSR was Moscow.
The USSR was founded in 1922 by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and four other Soviet republics: Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia, and Georgia. The USSR was a one-party state, with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) as the ruling party. The CPSU was led by a general secretary, who was the most powerful person in the USSR.
The USSR was a planned economy, with the government controlling the production and distribution of goods and services. The USSR was also a totalitarian state, with the government controlling all aspects of life.
The USSR played a major role in World War II, defeating Nazi Germany. After the war, the USSR became a superpower, rivaling the United States. The USSR was a member of the Warsaw Pact, a military alliance of communist countries.
The USSR began to decline in the 1980s, as a result of economic problems and political reforms. The USSR collapsed in 1991, and its constituent republics became independent states.
