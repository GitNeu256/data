The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), was a transcontinental country that spanned much of Eurasia from 1922 to 1991. A flagship communist state, it was nominally a federal union of fifteen national republics; in practice, both its government and its economy were highly centralized until its final years. It was a one-party state governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with the city of Moscow serving as its capital as well as that of its largest and most populous republic: the Russian SFSR. Other major cities included Leningrad (Russian SFSR), Kiev (Ukrainian SSR), Minsk (Byelorussian SSR), Tashkent (Uzbek SSR), Alma-Ata (Kazakh SSR), and Novosibirsk (Russian SFSR). It was the largest country in the world, covering over 22,402,200 square kilometres (8,649,500 sq mi) and spanning eleven time zones.
The country's roots lay in the October Revolution of 1917, which saw the Bolsheviks overthrow the Russian Provisional Government that formed earlier that year following the February Revolution and the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II, marking the end of the Russian Empire. The new government, led by Vladimir Lenin, established the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (RSFSR), the world's first constitutionally guaranteed socialist state. Persisting internal tensions escalated into the brutal Russian Civil War. As the war progressed in the Bolsheviks' favor, the RSFSR began to incorporate land conquered from the war into nominally independent states, which were unified into the Soviet Union in December 1922. Following Lenin's death in 1924, Joseph Stalin came to power. Stalin inaugurated a period of rapid industrialization and forced collectivization that led to significant economic growth, but also contributed to a famine in 1930–1933 that killed millions. The forced labour camp system of the Gulag was also expanded in this period. Stalin conducted the Great Purge to remove his actual and perceived opponents. After the outbreak of World War II, Germany invaded the Soviet Union. The combined Soviet civilian and military casualty count—estimated to be around 20 million people—accounted for the majority of losses of Allied forces. In the aftermath of World War II, the territory occupied by the Red Army formed various Soviet satellite states.
The beginning of the Cold War saw the Eastern Bloc of the Soviet Union confront the Western Bloc of the United States, with the latter grouping becoming largely united in 1949 under NATO and the former grouping becoming largely united in 1955 under the Warsaw Pact. There was no direct military confrontation between the two organizations; instead, the conflict was fought on an ideological basis and through proxy wars. Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact led to the expansion of military forces and their integration into the respective blocs. The Warsaw Pact's largest military engagement was the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, its own member state, in August 1968 (with the participation of all pact nations except Albania and Romania), which, in part, resulted in Albania withdrawing from the pact less than one month later. Following Stalin's death in 1953, a period known as de-Stalinization occurred under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev. The Soviets took an early lead in the Space Race with the first artificial satellite, the first human spaceflight, and the first probe to land on another planet (Venus).
In the 1970s, there was a brief détente in the Soviet Union's relationship with the United States, but tensions emerged again following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. In the mid-1980s, the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought to reform the country through his policies of glasnost and perestroika. In 1989, during the closing stages of the Cold War, various countries of the Warsaw Pact overthrew their Marxist–Leninist regimes, which was accompanied by the outbreak of strong nationalist and separatist movements across the entire Soviet Union. In 1991, Gorbachev initiated a national referendum—boycotted by the Soviet republics of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova—that resulted in the majority of participating citizens voting in favour of preserving the country as a renewed federation. In August 1991, hardline members of the Communist Party staged a coup d'état against Gorbachev; the attempt failed, with Boris Yeltsin playing a high-profile role in facing down the unrest, and the Communist Party was subsequently banned. The Russian Federation became the Soviet Union's successor state, while all of the other republics emerged from the USSR's collapse as fully independent post-Soviet states.
The Soviet Union produced many significant social and technological achievements and innovations. It had the world's second-largest economy, and the Soviet Armed Forces comprised the largest standing military in the world. An NPT-designated state, it possessed the largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world. It was a founding member of the United Nations as well as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Before the dissolution, the country had maintained its status as one of the world's two superpowers through its hegemony in Eastern Europe, military and economic strengths and scientific research.
Etymology
The word soviet is derived from the Russian word sovet, meaning 'council', 'assembly', 'advice', ultimately deriving from the proto-Slavic verbal stem of to inform, related to Slavic news, English wise, the root in ad-vis-or (which came to English through French), or the Dutch weten ('to know'; compare wetenschap meaning 'science'). The word sovietnik means 'councillor'. Some organizations in Russian history were called council. In the Russian Empire, the State Council, which functioned from 1810 to 1917, was referred to as a Council of Ministers.
The Soviets as workers' councils first appeared during the Russian Revolution of 1905. Although they were quickly suppressed by the Imperial army, after the February Revolution of 1917, workers' and soldiers' Soviets emerged throughout the country, and shared power with the Russian Provisional Government. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, demanded that all power be transferred to the Soviets, and gained support from the workers and soldiers. After the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks seized power from the Provisional Government in the name of the Soviets, Lenin proclaimed the formation of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic (RSFSR).
During the Georgian Affair of 1922, Lenin called for the Russian SFSR and other national Soviet republics to form a greater union which he initially named as the Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia. Joseph Stalin initially resisted Lenin's proposal but ultimately accepted it, and with Lenin's agreement he changed the name to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), although all republics began as socialist soviet and did not change to the other order until 1936. In addition, in the regional languages of several republics, the word council or conciliar in the respective language was only quite late changed to an adaptation of the Russian soviet and never in others, e.g. Ukrainian SSR.
SSSR is the abbreviation of the Russian language cognate of USSR, as written in Cyrillic letters. The Soviets used this abbreviation so frequently that audiences worldwide became familiar with its meaning. After this, the most common Russian initialization is Soyuz SSR which, after compensating for grammatical differences, essentially translates to Union of SSRs in English. In addition, the Russian short form name Sovjetskij Sojuz is also commonly used, but only in its unabbreviated form. Since the start of the Great Patriotic War at the latest, abbreviating the Russian name of the Soviet Union as СС (in the same way as, for example, United States is abbreviated into US) has been a complete taboo, the reason being that СС as a Russian Cyrillic abbreviation is instead associated with the infamous Schutzstaffel of Nazi Germany, just as SS is in English. One apparent exception was the Russian abbreviation the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, KPSS.
In English language media, the state was referred to as the Soviet Union or the USSR. In other European languages, the locally translated short forms and abbreviations are usually used such as Union soviétique and URSS in French, or Sowjetunion and UdSSR in German. The Russian SFSR dominated the Soviet Union to such an extent that for most of the Soviet Union's existence, it was commonly, but incorrectly, referred to as Russia. Technically, Russia itself was only one republic within the larger union—albeit by far the largest, most powerful and most highly developed of the 15 republics. Nevertheless, according to historian Matthew White, it was an open secret that the country's federal structure was "window dressing" for Russian dominance. For that reason, the people of the USSR were almost always called "Russians", not "Soviets", since "everyone knew who really ran the show".
History
Revolution and Foundation (1917-1927)
10 March to celebrate the 2nd anniversary of the Revolution Lenin, Trotsky and Kamenev
Modern revolutionary activities in the Russian Empire began with the Decabrist rebellion in 1825. Serfdom was abolished in 1861, but it was carried out in unfavorable conditions for peasants and served to encourage revolutionaries. Parliament — Lower House - Founded in 1905 after the Russian Revolution in 1906, but Emperor Nikolai 2 resisted attempts to transition from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy. Social unrest continued, exacerbated by military defeats and food shortages in major cities during the First World War.
The spontaneous mass demonstration in Petrograd in 1917/3/8 culminated in the 2 March Revolution and the abdication of Nicholas 2 and the imperial government, demanding peace and bread. Tsarist autocracy was replaced by the social democratic Russian Interim government, intended to hold elections to the Constituent Assembly of Russia and continue to fight on Entente's side in the First World War. At the same time, the Workers' Council, called "Soviet" in Russian, spread throughout the country, among which the most influential representatives of workers and soldiers Petrograd Soviet shared power with the interim government.
The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, promoted the communist revolution in the Soviet Union and on the streets, adopted the slogan "All power to the Soviet Union" and prompted the overthrow of the interim government. In 1917-11-7, the Bolshevik Red Army raided the Winter palace in Petrograd, arrested the leader of the interim government, and Lenin declared that all power had been transferred to the Soviet Union. This event was later officially known in the Soviet bibliography as the "Great 10th Socialist Revolution." The bloody red fear began to shut down all the opposites, both perceived and real. On May 12, the Bolsheviks signed an armistice agreement with the central power, but by 1918 the battle was resumed on May 2. On 3 May, the Soviets ended their involvement in the war and signed another peace treaty of Brest-Litovsk.
A long and bloody civil war broke out between the Reds and Whites, beginning in 1917 and ending with a victory for the Reds in 1923. It included foreign intervention, the killing of the former Emperor and his family, and the famine of about 500 million people between 1921 and 1922. In 1921-3, during the related war with Poland, the peace of Riga was signed, dividing the conflict areas of Belarus and Ukraine between the Polish Republic and Soviet Russia. Soviet Russia tried to re-conquer all the newly independent countries of the old Empire, although their success was limited. Estonia, Finland, Latvia and Lithuania all repelled Soviet aggression, while Ukraine, Belarus (as a result of the Polish–Soviet War), Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia were occupied by the Red Army. In addition, the forced expropriation of food by the Soviet government led to substantial resistance, the most prominent of which was the Tambov rebellion, which was eventually suppressed by the Red Army.
The Civil War had a devastating impact on the economy. Black markets have emerged in Russia, despite the threat of Martial law against profiteering. The Ruble collapsed, barter increasingly replaced money as a medium of exchange, and by 1921 the output of heavy industry fell to 1913 levels of 20%. 90% of wages were paid not by money, but by goods. 70% of the locomotives needed repair [Citation needed], and the conscription of food, combined with the effects of 7 years of war and severe drought, caused the death of 300 to 1000 million people. Coal production fell from 27.5 million tons (1913) to 7 million tons (1920), but the output of the whole plant also fell from 10,000 thousand rubles to 1,000 thousand rubles. Reduced to a million rubles. According to the distinguished historian David Christian, the crop yield was also reduced from 8,010 million tons (in 1913) to 4,650 million tons (in 1920).
Treaties on the Creation of the USSR
In 1922-12-28, the meeting of plenipotentiaries from the Russian SFSR, Transcaucasian SFSR, Ukrainian SSR and Belarusian SSR approved the Treaty on the creation of the Soviet Union and the Declaration on the creation of the Soviet Union, forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. These 2 documents were confirmed by the first Soviet Conference of the USSR, and in 1922-12-30 the head of the delegation Mikhail Kalinin, Mikhail Tskakaya, Mi The official declaration was made from the stage of the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow.
The intensive restructuring of the economy, industry and politics of the country began in the early days of Soviet power in 1917. Most of this was done according to the first decree of the Bolsheviks, a government document signed by Vladimir Lenin. 1. One of the most notable breakthroughs was the GOELRO plan, which envisioned a large-scale reconstruction of the Soviet economy based on the total electrification of Russia. This was the prototype of the subsequent five-year plan, which was achieved by 1931. After the economic policy of "war communism" in the Russian Civil War, as a harbinger of the full development of socialism in the country, in the 1920s the Soviet government allowed several private companies to coexist with state-owned industries, and the total food collection in the countryside was replaced by a food tax.
From its creation, the government of the Soviet Union was based on the one-party rule of the Communist Party (the Bolsheviks). The stated purpose is to prevent the return of capitalist exploitation, and the principle of democratic centralism is most effective in expressing the will of the people in a practical way and the debate over the future of the economy provided the background to the power struggle of the years after Lenin's death in 1924. Initially, Lenin was involved in the "Troika", consisting of Grigory Zinoviev of the Ukrainian SSR, Lev Kamenev of the Russian Sfsr, and Joseph Stalin of the Sfsr of Transcaucasia.
In 1924/2/1, the Soviet Union was recognized by Britain. In the same year, the Soviet Constitution was approved and justified the union of 1922-12.
According to Archie Brown, the Constitution was not an accurate guide to the political reality of the Soviet Union. For example, the fact that the Party played a leading role in the formulation and execution of policies was not mentioned until 1977. The USSR was a federal organization of many constituent republics, each of which had its own political and administrative organization. However, the term "Soviet Russia", officially applied only to the Socialist Republic of the Russian Federation, was often applied to the whole country by non-Soviet writers, due to the rule of the Russian SFSR.
Stalin era (1927-1953)
In 1922, 4/3, Stalin was appointed general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Lenin appointed Stalin the head of the inspector of workers and peasants, giving Stalin considerable power. By gradually consolidating his influence, isolating and defeating rivals within the party, Stalin became the undisputed leader of the country and, by the end of the 1920s, established totalitarian rules. In 1927-10, Zinoviev and Leon Trotsky were expelled from the Central Committee and forced into exile.
In 1928, Stalin introduced the first five-year plan to build a socialist economy. Instead of the internationalism expressed by Lenin throughout the revolution, it aimed to build socialism in one country. In industry, the state controlled all existing enterprises and carried out an intensive program of industrialization. In agriculture, forced collectivization of farms was implemented throughout the country, rather than sticking to the policy of "guidance by example" advocated by Lenin.
The result was famine, deaths estimated at 300 million to 700 million, and the surviving Krak (wealthy or middle-class farmers) were persecuted, many sent to Gulag for forced labor. Social upheaval continued in the mid-1930s, and despite the turmoil of the mid- to late 1930s, it developed a robust industrial economy before World War II.
Closer cooperation between the Soviet Union and the West developed in the early 1930s, and from 1932 to 1934, the country participated in the World Conference on Disarmament. In 1933, diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union were established, and on May 11, newly elected US President Franklin D. Roosevelt officially approved Stalin's Communist government and negotiated a new trade agreement between the two countries. In 1934-9, the country joined the League of Nations. After the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, the Soviet Union actively supported the Republican army against nationalists backed by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.
In 1936-12, Stalin published a new constitution, which was praised by supporters around the world as the most democratic constitution imaginable, but there was also skepticism. American historian J.Arch Getty notes that "Many who admired Stalin's Soviet Union as the most democratic country on Earth lived to regret their words. After all, the Soviet Constitution of 1936 was adopted on the eve of the great horrors of the late 1930s; the first "thoroughly democratic" elections to the Supreme Soviet allowed only contested candidates and took place at the height of the barbaric violence of 1937. The civil rights, individual freedoms and democratic forms promised in the Stalin Constitution were trampled almost immediately and remained a dead letter long after Stalin's death."
Stalin's great purge resulted in the detention or execution of many "old Bolsheviks" who participated in the October Revolution. According to declassified Soviet archives, the NKVD in 1937 and 1938 arrested more than 150 million people, of which 681,692 were shot. In the last 2 years, more than 1 in 1,000 executions were carried out on average.
In 1939, after a failed attempt to form a military alliance with Britain and France against Germany, the Soviet Union made a dramatic change towards Nazi Germany. Almost 1 year after Britain and France signed the Munich Agreement with Germany, the Soviet Union signed an agreement with Germany both militarily and economically during extensive consultations. Unlike in the case of Britain and France, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Agreement (signed in 1939-8-23), an agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany, contained a secret protocol that paved the way for the Soviets to invade Eastern European countries and occupy their territories. The agreement allowed the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Bessarabia, North Bukowina and east Poland.
On 9/1, Germany invaded Poland, and on 17, the Soviet Union also invaded Poland. 10/6 Poland fell and part of the Soviet-occupied territory was handed over to Germany.
10/10 The Soviet Union and Lithuania signed an agreement that the Soviet Union would transfer Poland's sovereignty over the Vilna region to Lithuania, and on the 28th the border between the Soviet occupied territories and the new territories of Lithuania was officially demarcated.
11/1 The Soviet Union annexed West Ukraine and West Belarus on the 2nd.
In late May 11, Stalin ordered the invasion of Finland because he could not force the Republic of Finland by diplomatic means to move the border 25 km (16 miles) from Leningrad. In 1939-12-14, the Soviet Union was expelled from the League of Nations for its invasion of Finland. In the East, the Soviet army won several decisive victories during the border clashes with the Empire of Japan in 1938 and 1939. However, in 1941-4, the Soviet Union signed a Japan-Soviet neutrality agreement with Japan, and in 1945 the Soviet Union unilaterally broke it, recognizing the territorial integrity of Manchukuo, a puppet state of Japan. The agreement ensured that Japan would not later join the war with the Soviet Union on the German side.

Germany broke the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement and invaded the Soviet Union in 1941-6-22, as a Great Patriotic War in Russia and several other post-Soviet states The Red Army stopped the seemingly invincible German army at the Battle of Moscow. The Battle of Stalingrad, which lasted from the end of 1942 to the beginning of 1943, dealt a serious blow to Germany and did not fully recover from it, which marked a turning point in the war. After Stalingrad, Soviet troops went through eastern Europe to Berlin before the surrender of Germany in 1945. The Germans suffered 80% of the army's deaths on the Eastern front. Harry Hopkins, a diplomatic adviser to Franklin D. Roosevelt, wrote in 1943 about the decisive role of the Soviet Union in the war at 8.10 am: "In Sicily, British and American troops are opposed by 2 German divisions, but the Russian Front attracts the attention of about 200 German divisions."The number of soldiers who served in the Red Army during the Second World War was up to 3400 million, of which 800 million were non-Slavic minorities.
The Soviet Union suffered greatly in the war and lost about 2,000 million people (modern Russian sources put their number at 2,660 million). This includes 870 million military deaths. Most of the losses were made by the Russian People, followed by the Ukrainian people. About 280 million Soviet POWs died of starvation, abuse, or execution between 1941 and 1942 in just 8 months. More than 3 million people were killed in Belarus during the 200-year German occupation, and almost 55% of the region's population, including about 4 million Jews, was killed in the Belarusian Holocaust in 1 year. During the war, the country was considered 4 great powers along with the United States, Britain and China, and later became 4 policemen who formed the basis of the UN Security Council. It emerged as a superpower in the post-war era. The Soviet Union, once denied diplomatic recognition by Western countries, had official relations with virtually all countries by the late 1940s. He was a member of the United Nations, established in 1945, and became one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, giving him the right to reject any of its resolutions.
The Soviet Union fulfilled the agreement with the Allies at the Yalta Conference, broke the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Agreement, which Japan respected despite its alliance with Germany in 1945-4, and invaded Japan-controlled areas including Manchukuo in 1945-8-9. The conflict ended with a decisive Soviet victory, which contributed to the unconditional surrender of Japan and the end of World War II.
Soviet soldiers committed mass rape in the occupied territories, especially in Germany. Decades of silence followed the wartime rape. According to historian Antony Beaver, whose books were banned from several Russian schools and universities in 2015, the files of the NKVD (Soviet Secret Police), it was often the units of the rear hierarchy that the leadership committed rape what happened. According to Professor Oleg Rzheshevsky, "4,148 Red Army officers and many privateers were punished for committing atrocities." The exact number of German women and girls raped by Soviet troops during the war and occupation is unknown, but historians estimate that their number could reach hundreds of thousands, possibly as many as 200 million.
The Soviet Union was greatly assisted in wartime efforts by the United States through lendlease. In total, the delivery of the United States to the USSR by lendlease amounted toド1.1 billion: more than 400,000 jeeps and trucks, 12,000 armored vehicles (including 7,000 tanks, about 1,386 M3Lees and 4,102 M4shermans), 11,400 aircraft (4,719 Bell P-39Airacobras, 3,414 Douglas It was A-20Havocs.2,397 were Bell P-63 King Cobra) and 1.75 million tons of food. With Soviet soldiers bearing the brunt of the war, Roosevelt's adviser Harry Hopkins felt that American aid to the Soviet Union would hasten the conclusion of the war.
Approximately 1,750 million tons of military equipment, vehicles, industrial goods and food were shipped from the Western Hemisphere to the Soviet Union, with 94% coming from the United States. For comparison, from 1942-1 to 1945-5, a total of 2,200 million tons landed in Europe to supply American troops. Only American deliveries to the Soviet Union through the Persian Corridor, by US military standards, are estimated to have been enough to maintain 60 combat divisions in the line.
Cold War
In the immediate post-war period, the Soviet Union rebuilt and expanded its economy, maintaining strict centralized control. It effectively controlled most of the countries of Eastern Europe (except Yugoslavia and later Albania) and turned them into satellite states. The Soviet Union joined satellite states in 1955 with the Warsaw Pact, a military alliance, and between 1949 and 1991 with the Mutual Economic Assistance Council or Comecon, an economic organization equivalent to the European Economic Community (EEC). Although nominally a "defensive" alliance, the main function of the Warsaw Pact was to defend the Soviet hegemony over the satellites of Eastern Europe, and the only direct military action of the treaty was the invasion of Member States to ensure that the member States did not fall apart. The Soviet Union concentrated on its own recovery, seizing and relocating most of the German industrial factories, and using Soviet-controlled joint ventures from East Germany, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria to force war reparations. It also enacted trading arrangements that were deliberately designed to support the country. Moscow controlled the Communist Party, which controlled the satellite state, and obeyed orders from the Kremlin. Historian Mark Kramer said: "The net outflow of resources from Eastern Europe to the Soviet Union in the first 10 years after World War II was about1150 billion to2200 billion, which was approximately equal to the total aid the United States provided to Western Europe under the Marshall Plan."Then the Comecon eventually provided assistance to the victorious Communist Party of China, and its influence grew elsewhere in the world. Fearing its ambitions, Britain and America, the wartime allies of the Soviet Union, became its enemies. In the subsequent Cold War, the two sides indirectly clashed in proxy wars.
De-Stalinization and thawing of Khrushchev (1953-1964)
Stalin died in 1953/3/5. In the absence of mutually agreeable successors, the highest cadres of the Communist Party initially chose to jointly control the Soviet Union through the Troika, led by Georgy Marenkov. But this did not last long, and Nikita Khrushchev won the subsequent power struggle by the mid-1950s, and in 1956 he blamed Joseph Stalin and eased control of the party and society. This was known as de-Stalinization.
Moscow considered Eastern Europe a very important buffer zone for forward defense of Western borders in case of another major invasion, such as the German invasion of 1941, for this reason, the Soviet Union sought to consolidate control of the region by relying and subordinating to its leadership by turning Eastern European countries into satellite states. As a result, Soviet troops were used to suppress an anti-Communist uprising in Hungary in 1956.
The confrontation with China over Soviet reconciliation with the West in the late 1950s, and what Mao Zedong perceived as Khrushchev's revisionism, led to the Sino-Soviet split. This led to a break in the entire global Marxist–Leninist movement, with the governments of Albania, Cambodia and Somalia choosing to ally with China.
During this period in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Soviet Union continued to realize scientific and technological achievements in the space race, launching in 1957 the first satellite Sputnik 1, a living dog named Leica in 1957, the first human Yuri Gagarin in 1961, Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space in 1963, and 1965 The first person to walk in space in the year Alexei Leonov, the first soft landing on the Moon by the spacecraft Luna 1966-9, the first lunar probes, Lunohot 1 and Lunohot 2, were launched.
Khrushchev launched a "thaw" - a complex change in the political, cultural and economic life of the country. This included some openness and contact with other countries, as well as new socio-economic policies with an emphasis on primary commodities, which allowed for a dramatic rise in living standards while maintaining high levels of economic growth. Censorship has also been eased. However, the agricultural and administrative reforms of Khrushchev were generally unproductive. In 1962, he caused a crisis with the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba. An agreement was made with the United States to remove nuclear missiles from both Cuba and Turkey, which concluded the crisis. This event caused Khrushchev a lot of embarrassment and loss of prestige, which led to his removal from power in 1964.
Period of stagnation (1964-1985)
After Khrushchev's downfall, Leonid Brezhnev was the General Secretary, Alexei Kosygin was the Prime Minister and Nikolai Podgorny was the chairman, which lasted until Brezhnev established himself as the outstanding leader of the Soviet Union in the early 1970s.
In 1968, allies of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact invaded Czechoslovakia to quell Prague's spring reforms. Brezhnev then justified aggression and previous military interventions, as well as potential military interventions in the future, by declaring the threat to Soviet rule in Warsaw Treaty Organization member states as a threat to all Warsaw Treaty Organization member states and introducing the Brezhnev Doctrine justifying military intervention.
Brezhnev signed treaties on arms control with the West (SALT I, SALT II, Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaties) and at the same time strengthened the power of the Soviet army.
1977-10, the 3rd Soviet Constitution was adopted unanimously. The prevailing mood of the Soviet leader at the time of Brezhnev's death in 1982 was one of the 1% aversion to change. The long period of Brezhnev's rule, along with the aging and ossified top political leaders, came to be called 1 of the "stops." This period is also known as a period of stagnation, an era of unfavorable economic, political and social influence of the country, which began during the rule of Brezhnev and continued under his successors Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko.
In late 1979, Soviet troops intervened in the ongoing civil war in neighboring Afghanistan, effectively ending tensions with the West.
Perestroika and Glasnost Reforms (1985-1991)
What dominated the subsequent 10 years were the increasingly obvious collapse of the economic and political structure of the Soviet Union and the development of 2 attempts at a patchwork of reforms to reverse the process. Kenneth S. Defies argued in "Beyond Oil" that the Reagan administration encouraged Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil to a point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling oil, which resulted in the depletion of the country's rigid foreign exchange reserves.
The next 2 successors of Brezhnev, a transitional figure with deep roots in his traditions, did not last long. Yuri Andropov was 68 and Konstantin Chernenko came to power at the age of 72, but both died less than 2 years later. In order to avoid the third short-lived leader, in 1985, the Soviets turned to the next generation and chose Mikhail Gorbachev. In addition to the failed economy, the prolonged war in Afghanistan led to an increase in public dissatisfaction with the communist regime. Also, the Chernobyl accident in 1986 added impetus to Gorbachev's reforms. He brought great changes to the economy and the leadership of the party, which is called Perestroika. His Glasnost policy freed the public access to information after decades of harsh government censorship. Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War. In 1988, the Soviet Union abandoned the war in Afghanistan and began to withdraw its forces. The following year, Gorbachev refused to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet satellite state, paving the way for the revolution of 1989. In particular, the cessation of the Soviet Union in the Pan-European picnic of 1989-8 caused a peaceful chain reaction, at the end of which the Eastern bloc collapsed. As the Berlin Wall collapsed and East and West Germany pursued reunification, the iron curtain between the West and the Soviet-occupied territories came down.
At the same time, the Soviet Republic launched a legal motion to potentially declare sovereignty over the territory, citing the freedom to secede in Article 72 of the Soviet Constitution. In 1990, a law was passed allowing the Republic to leave if more than 4.7 percent of the population voted in a referendum - 3.2 percent. Many held the first free elections in Soviet times for their national Assembly in 1990. Many of these parliaments began to create laws that contradicted union law, in what was known as the "war of Laws." In 1989, the SFSR of Russia convened a meeting of the newly elected People's Deputies. Boris Yeltsin was elected its chairman. In 1990-6-12, the Parliament passed a law that declared sovereignty over the territory of Russia and tried to replace several Soviet laws. After the landslide victory of Sujdis in Lithuania, the country declared that it had restored independence in 1990-3-11, citing the illegality of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states Soviet forces tried to stop the separation by crushing popular demonstrations in Lithuania (blood Sunday) and Latvia (barricades), as a result of which a large number of civilians were killed or injured. It was. But these actions only strengthened international support for the separatists.
In 1991, a referendum for the preservation of the USSR was held in 3-17 9 republics (the remaining republics boycotted the vote), and the majority of the population of those republics voted for the preservation of the union in the form of a new federation. The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost. In the summer of 1991, a new union treaty, which would have turned the country into a much looser union, was agreed by 8 republics. However, the signing of the treaty was an attempted coup by the government and hard-line members of the KGB, who tried to reverse Gorbachev's reforms and reaffirm the central government's control over the Republic. After the collapse of the coup, Russian President Yeltsin was considered the hero of his decisive action, but Gorbachev's power practically ended. The balance of power leaned heavily on the Republic. In 1991-8, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of full independence (following the example of Lithuania in 1990). Gorbachev resigned as general secretary in late May 8, shortly after which the party's activities were suspended indefinitely and virtually ended its rule. By autumn, Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside Moscow and was elected President of Russia in 1991-7 by Yeltsin.
Dissolution and Aftermath
The remaining 12 republics continued to discuss new, increasingly loose models of unions. But by the 12th Month, everything except Russia and Kazakhstan officially declared independence. During this time, Yeltsin took over the rest of the Soviet government, including the Moscow Kremlin. The last blow was struck on 12/1, when Ukraine, the 2nd most powerful republic, overwhelmingly voted for independence. The withdrawal of Ukraine ended a realistic chance for the country to stay together, even on a limited scale.
In 1991-12-8, the Presidents of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus (formerly Belarus) signed the Belavezha Agreement, which declared that the Soviet Union would dissolve and in its place establish the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Doubts remained over the authority of the agreement to do this, but in 1991-12-21, representatives of all Soviet Republics except Georgia signed the Alma-Ata protocol, which confirmed the agreement. In 1991-12-25, Gorbachev resigned as president of the Soviet Union and declared that the office was extinct. He turned the power that belonged to the president to Yeltsin. That night, the Soviet flag was lowered last, and the Russian tricolor was raised in its place.
The next day, the Supreme Soviet, the highest government agency, voted both itself and the country out of existence. It is generally perceived as marking the official, final dissolution of the Soviet Union as a functioning state, and the end of the Cold War. The Soviet army was initially under the command of the entire CIS, but was soon absorbed by the various military forces of the new and independent states. Some remaining Soviet institutions, which had not been taken over by Russia, ceased to function by the end of 1991.
After the dissolution, Russia was internationally recognized as the legal successor of the Soviet Union on the international stage. To that end, Russia voluntarily accepted all Soviet external debt and claimed the Soviet overseas property as its own. Under the Lisbon Protocol of 1992, Russia also agreed to receive all nuclear weapons remaining on the territory of other former Soviet republics. Since then, the Russian Federation has assumed the rights and obligations of the Soviet Union and is widely seen as the successor state to the Soviet Union. Ukraine refuses to recognize the exclusive Russian claim to Soviet succession and has claimed such status for Ukraine as well, since independence in 1991, Ukraine has continued to pursue claims against Russia in foreign courts, seeking to restore the share of foreign property owned by the Soviet Union.
Summarizing the international impact of these events, Vladislav Zubok said:"The collapse of the Soviet Empire was an event of epoch-making geopolitical, military, ideological and economic importance."Before the dissolution, the country maintained its position as one of the two superpowers of the world for forty years after World War II with hegemony in Eastern Europe, military power, economic power, scientific research, especially space technology and weapons.
Post-Soviet states
The analysis of state succession for 15 post-Soviet states is complex. The Russian Federation is widely seen as a legitimate continuing state and for most purposes is the heir of the Soviet Union. It retained ownership of all former Soviet embassies, inherited full Soviet nuclear weapons, and also inherited the UN membership of the Soviet Union, a permanent member of the Security Council.
Of the other 2 co-founding countries of the Soviet Union at the time of dissolution, Ukraine was the only country that passed the law, as did Russia, claiming to be the national successor of both the Ukrainian SSR and the Soviet Union. The Soviet treaty not only laid the foundation for Ukraine's future foreign agreements, but also led to countries that agreed to undertake 16.37% of the Soviet debt, which was supposed to receive a share of the Soviet foreign property. Russia's position as the "sole continuation of the Soviet Union", which became widely accepted in the West, as well as constant pressure from the West, allowed Russia to inherit Soviet state property abroad and hide information about it. Therefore, Ukraine refused to disclose information about the Soviet gold reserves and their diamond funds, as the Russian Federation has not ratified the "zero Option" agreement signed with other former Soviet republics. The dispute over former Soviet property and assets between the 2 former Republics is still ongoing:
The dispute cannot be resolved. We can continue to poke Kiev handouts in the calculation of "solve the problem", it will not solve alone. It is also pointless to go to court: for many European countries, this is a political issue, and they will make a clear decision in their favor. What to do in this situation is an open question. Search for non-trivial solutions. However, it should be remembered that in 2014, with the filing of the then Ukrainian Prime Minister Yatsenyuk, litigation with Russia was resumed in 32 countries. -sergei markov.
A similar situation occurred with the return of cultural properties. In 1992-2-14, Russia and other former Soviet Republics signed an agreement "on the return of cultural and historical property to the country of origin" in Minsk, but it was eventually stopped by the Russian Duma, which passed "the Federal Law on cultural valuables transferred to the USSR as a result of World War II and located on the territory of the Russian Federation", which now makes it impossible to return and is looted by Soviet troops during World War II. It is effectively prohibited for the returned cultural heritage to its original owner.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania see it as the revival of the 1940s of the 3 independent states that existed before it was occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union. They argue that the process they built into the Soviet Union violated both international law and their own laws, and that from 1990 to 1991 they were re-evaluating the independence that still existed legally.
Almost all post-Soviet states suffered a deep and prolonged recession after shock therapy, and poverty increased more than 10 times. A 2001 study by economist Steven Rosefielde calculated that between 1990 and 1998 there were 340 million premature deaths in Russia, partly blaming "shock therapy" associated with the Washington consensus.
In 2011, the Guardian published an analysis of the former Soviet countries 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. They found that "in some republics, in the 1990s GDP fell by as much as 50%." Capital flight, industrial collapse, hyperinflation, and tax avoidance were sacrificed, but recovered in the 2000s, and by 2010 the economy was 5 times the size of 1991. Similarly, some countries held free and fair elections, while others were authoritarian.
In addition, there are six states that claim independence from other internationally recognized post-Soviet states, but international recognition is limited: Abkhazia, Altsav, Donetsk, Luhansk, South Ossetia, Transnistria. The Chechen Separatist Movement of the Chechen・Ichekelia Republic, the Gagauz Separatist Movement of the Gagauz Republic and the Talish-Mugan Autonomous Republic are other such cases that have already been resolved.
Geography
With an area of 22,402,200 square kilometers (8,649,500 square miles), the Soviet Union was the largest country in the world and a position held by the Russian Federation. It covered 6'1 of the Earth's surface and its size was comparable to that of North America. The other two successor countries, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, ranked among the top 10 countries by land area, respectively, and completely the largest countries in Europe. The European part occupied a quarter of the country's area and was a cultural and economic center. The eastern part of Asia spread to the Pacific Ocean in the east and Afghanistan in the south, with the exception of some parts of Central Asia, with a much smaller population. It spanned more than 11 kilometers (10,000 miles) from east to west over 6,200 time zones and more than 7,200 kilometers (4,500 miles) from north to south. There were 5 climatic zones: tundra, Taiga, steppe, desert and mountain.
The Soviet Union, like Russia, had the longest border in the world, measuring more than 60,000 kilometers (37,000 miles), or 1+1⁄2 laps of the Earth. That 3'2 was the coastline. The country borders Afghanistan, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Hungary, Iran, Mongolia, North Korea, Norway, Poland, Romania and Turkey from 1945 to 1991. The Bering Strait separated the Soviet Union from the United States.
The highest mountain in the country is the Communist Peak (present-day Ismoyl Somoni Peak) in Tajikistan, at 7,495 meters (24,590 feet). The USSR included most of the largest lakes in the world.The Caspian Sea (shared with Iran), and Lake Baikal, the largest (by volume) in the world, which is also the internal waters of Russia
Government and Politics
Thanks for the power of the hierarchy in the legislative branch of the USSR - represented by the supreme Soviet government of the USSR, represented by the Council of Ministers, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), statutory persons and final policy officials.
Communist Party
At the top of the Communist Party was the Central Committee, which was elected at party meetings and conferences. In turn, the Central Committee voted for the Politburo (from 1952 to 1966 it was called the presidium), the Secretariat, the General Secretary (from 1953 to 1966 - the first Secretary) and the virtually highest office in the Soviet Union. Depending on the degree of consolidation of power, it was either the Politburo as a collective body or the General Secretary, who was always one of the members of the Politburo (exercised directly through his position in the Council of Ministers, not in the politburo since 1941, except for the period of Stalin's highly personalized authority), who effectively led the party and the country. An important principle of the party organization was democratic centralism, demanding strict subordination to higher institutions, and since the elections were not contested in favor of the proposed candidates from above, they were not controlled by the membership of the party in general.
The Communist Party maintained control over the state, mainly by controlling the appointment system. All government officials and most deputies of the Supreme Soviet were members of the CPSU. In the head of the party, Stalin (1941-1953) and Khrushchev (1958-1964) were prime ministers. At the time of Khrushchev's forced retirement, the party leader was banned from this kind of dual membership, but the general secretary after at least a part of his term occupied mainly ceremonial positions of the chairman of the Supreme Soviet President, the nominal head of state. Institutions at the lower level were overseen and sometimes replaced by major party organizations.
In practice, however, the degree of control the party was able to exercise over the state bureaucracy was far from complete, especially in the pursuit of the different interests that the bureaucracy had at odds with the party after Stalin's death, and the party itself was not monolithic from top to bottom, even though it was officially banned.
Government
The Supreme Soviet (successor of the Soviet Parliament) was nominally the supreme state institution for most of Soviet history, initially acting as a rubber stamp institution, approving and executing all the decisions made by the party. However, its powers and functions were extended in the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including the creation of new state committees and commissions. It gained additional authority on the approval of the 5-year plan and the government budget. The Supreme Soviet Union elected the President (successor to the Central Executive Committee) to exercise power during the plenary session, which was usually held 2 times a year, appointed the Supreme Court, the Procuratorate and the Council of Ministers (known as the People's Committee before 1946), chaired by the President (Prime Minister) and operated a huge bureaucracy in charge of the operation of the economy and society. Unlike other constituent republics, the Russian SFSR did not have a Republican branch of the CPSU for most of its history and was directly controlled by the party of the entire union until 1990, but the state and party structures of the constituent republics largely emulated the structure of the central institutions. Local authorities were similarly organized into party committees, regional Soviet and executive committees. The state system was nominally federal, but the party was unified.
The National Security Police (the KGB and its predecessor institutions) played an important role in Soviet politics. It served in the Red terror and the Great purges, but after the death of Stalin was put under strict party control. Under Yuri Andropov, the KGB engaged in the suppression of political dissent, maintaining an extensive network of informants, re-evaluating its status as a political actor somewhat independent of party and state structures, culminating in an anti-corruption campaign targeting party officials in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Separation and reform of power
The Constitution, promulgated in 1924, 1936 and 1977, did not restrict state power. There was no formal separation of powers between the executive branch of government and the party representing the legislative branch, the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Ministers. This system was less governed by statutes than by informal customs, and there was no settled mechanism of succession of leaders. After the deaths of Lenin and Stalin, and after the dismissal of Khrushchev, a bitter and sometimes fatal power struggle broke out in the Politburo due to the decisions of both the Politburo and the Central Committee.The leaders of the Communist Party before Gorbachev's death during his tenure were both dismissed from the party leadership in the struggle within the party, with the exception of Georgy Marenkov and Khrushchev.
From 1988 to 1990, Mikhail Gorbachev instituted reforms to shift power from the party's highest institutions and not let the supreme Soviet depend on them. A meeting of the People's Deputies was established, and the majority of its members were directly elected in competitive elections held in 1989, the first in Soviet history. The Parliament has now become a full-time parliament and elected the supreme Soviet, much more powerful than before. For the first time since the 1920s, he rubber-stamped proposals from the Party and the Council of Ministers. In 1990, Gorbachev introduced the position of President of the Soviet Union, concentrating power in his executive branch, independent of the party, subordinating the government and now renaming the cabinet of Soviet ministers to himself.
Tensions rose between the authorities of the whole federation under Gorbachev, the reformists who ruled in Russia by Boris Yeltsin and the newly elected supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR, and the communist hardliners. Between 1991-8-19-21, a group of hardliners staged a coup attempt. The coup failed, and the State Council of the Soviet Union became the highest body of state power "in the transitional period". Gorbachev resigned as general secretary and left the president only for the last months of the existence of the Soviet Union.
Judicial system
The judiciary was not independent of other branches of government. The Supreme Court oversaw the lower courts (People's courts) and applied the laws established by the Constitution or interpreted by the Supreme Soviet. The Constitutional Monitoring Committee examined the constitutionality of laws and acts. The Soviet Union used the inquisition system of Roman law, which allowed judges, prosecutors and defense lawyers to work together to "establish the truth."
Human rights
Human rights in the Soviet Union were severely restricted. The Soviet Union was a totalitarian state from 1927 to 1953 and a one-party state until 1990. Freedom of speech was suppressed and dissent was punished. Independent political activity was not tolerated, whether or not it included participation in free trade unions, private companies, independent churches and opposition parties. Freedom of movement within and outside the country in particular was limited. The state restricted the rights of citizens to private property.
The concept of human rights in the USSR was very different from international law. According to Soviet legal theory, "it is the government that is the beneficiary of human rights that is claimed against individuals." The Soviet state was considered a source of human rights. Thus, the Soviet legal system saw the law as an arm of politics, and the courts as an institution of government. The secret police bodies of the Soviet Union were given a wide range of extra-legal powers. The Soviet government, in fact, significantly suppressed the rule of law, civil liberties, protection of law, freedom of movement, and the guarantee of property, which were considered by Soviet legal theorists such as Andrey Vyshinsky as examples of "Bourgeois morality." According to Vladimir Lenin, the purpose of the socialist Court was "not to exclude terrorism." But to demonstrate it and, in principle, to justify it".
The Soviet Union signed a legally binding human rights document in 1973, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but it was not widely known, accessible and taken seriously by communist authorities to those under communist rule.
