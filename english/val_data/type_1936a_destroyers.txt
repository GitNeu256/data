The 1934 destroyers, also called the Z1 or Leberecht-Maas class after the lead ship, were a group of four destroyers built for the German Navy (originally called the Reichsmarine and renamed the Kriegsmarine in 1935) in the mid-1930s, just before the start of World War II. All four ships were named after German officers killed in action in World War I. All four ships were named after German officers killed in World War I.
Z1 Leberecht Maas attacked Polish ships during the invasion of Poland, but to no avail, while her sister ships, Z2 Georg Thiele and Z4 Richard Beitzen, temporarily blockaded the Polish coast. Later that month, the three sisters helped lay minefields in German Bay, then began patrolling the Skagerrak to inspect neutral ships for contraband; Z3 Max Schultz joined them in early October; Z4 Richard Beitzen was in England in late 1939 and early 1940 They laid several minefields off the coast, and in 1940 Max Schultz joined the mission off Harwich.
In February 1940, Z1 Leberecht Maass, Z3 Max Schulz, and Z4 Richard Beitzen were accidentally attacked by Luftwaffe bombers while attacking British fishing boats as part of Operation Vikinger. Z3 Max Schulz was trying to save his sister when he hit a mine and sank with the loss of his entire crew.
Z2 Georg Thiele took part in both battles of Narvik, helping to transfer troops to occupy Narvik during the invasion of Norway in April. She was heavily damaged by British destroyers during the second Battle of Narvik and was forced to sink herself. z4 Richard Bazen was the only one of the four sisters to survive the war, despite engaging British destroyers several times in the English Channel in 1941 and participating in the Battle of the Barents Sea in late 1942. until the end of the war in 1945. She spent most of the rest of the war escorting convoys to and from Norway. Richard Bazen was turned over to the Royal Navy and scrapped four years later.
Background
Design work on the Type 34 destroyer began in 1932, despite the 800-ton (810 t) limit imposed by the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I. The original design envisioned a larger ship, more powerful than the French and Polish destroyers in service at the time, but the design was expanded as the Imperial Navy came to expect her to serve as a small cruiser. Since France and Great Britain did not disarm, Germany decided to ignore the restrictions, and the 800-ton destroyers were hopelessly outclassed by destroyers being built by foreign navies Specifications were finalized in 1934, and four ships were ordered in July of that year. The design appears to have been rushed and not well thought out, as the short foremast and lack of flare in the bow made the ship seaworthy and inadequately stable. The only innovation in the design, the high-pressure boiler, was so complex that it was rarely tested on board before being installed in the Type 34, and it failed frequently for the life of the ship. By the time the ship was completed, Germany had already signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, effectively overturning the naval provisions of the Treaty of Versailles and making it legal to discharge the ship.
General Characteristics
The 1934 destroyer was 114 meters long, with a draft of 116.25 meters and an overall length of 119 meters. She was designed with a draft of 3.82 m (12 ft 6 in), but when fully loaded her draft was 4.23 m (13 ft 11 in) and her overall width was 11.31 m (37 ft 1 in). Designed to discharge 2,578 long tons (2,619 tons), she discharged 2,223 long tons (2,259 tons) at standard load and 3,156 long tons (3,207 tons) at full load. The ship's center of gravity was 0.79 m (0.6 m) when fully loaded and 0.6 m (0.6 m) when half-loaded.Type 34 was divided into 15 watertight compartments, the middle seven of which carried propulsion and auxiliary machinery, and was protected by a double bottom over 48% of its length. Active stabilizers were fitted to reduce roll. She had 10 officers and 315 enlisted men, plus four officers and 19 enlisted men when serving as a fleet flagship, and was equipped with two motor pinnaces and one torpedo cutter.
The 1934 destroyer was propelled by a pair of Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one three-bladed 3.25m propeller and superheated steam supplied by six Wagner water tube boilers at a pressure of 70 bar (1,029 psi; 7,093 kPa) and temperature of 450°C. The turbine had a total output of 70,000 shaft horsepower (52,000 kW) and a design speed of 36 knots (67 km/h, 41 mph), but actual maximum speed was 38.7 knots (71.7 km/h, 44.5 mph).Type 34 could carry up to 752 tons (740 t) of fuel oil and could make 19 knots ( 35 km/h (22 mph) and was intended to have a range of 4,400 nautical miles (8,100 km, 5,100 miles), but when commissioned she proved to be top heavy and 30% of her fuel had to be held as ballast low in the ship. Her effective range was found to be only 1,530 nautical miles (2,830 km; 1,760 miles) at 19 knots. The ship was equipped with two 200-kilowatt (270 hp) steam-driven turbogenerators, one in each engine room, and three diesel generators, two 60-kilowatt (80 hp) and one 30-kilowatt (40 hp) in the compartment between the two rear boiler rooms.
The ship was armed with five 12.7 cm (5-inch) guns mounted on single gun mounts with gun shields stacked two each at the front and rear of the superstructure; the fifth gun was mounted on top of the rear superstructure. It had a maximum range of 17.4 km (19,000 yards) and could be raised to 30 degrees and lowered to -10 degrees. Its anti-aircraft armament consisted of four single-loading 3.7cm anti-aircraft guns with a capacity of 8,000 rounds and six single-loading 2cm anti-aircraft guns with a capacity of 12,000 rounds. In addition, eight 53.3cm torpedo tubes were mounted on two quadruple torpedo launchers on the centerline, with a pair of reloaders on each launcher. Four torpedo launchers were mounted on the sides of the aft deckhouse, and an additional six torpedo racks were mounted on the aft sides, which could carry 32 or 64 torpedoes. The aft deck was equipped with a mine rail that could carry up to 60 mines. To detect submarines, they were equipped with a passive underwater listening device called "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) The total cost of the four ships was 54,749,000 marks.
The Type 34 was equipped with a C/34Z analog fire control director on the bridge roof and calculated gun battle data using the estimated range provided by the aft funnel and two 4 meter (13 foot) stereo rangefinders located just behind the director. Azimuth and elevation data were transmitted to the gun crews, who fired the guns simultaneously; the 1.25-meter rangefinder provided data to the 3.7-centimeter AA gun, while the 2-centimeter gun used a hand-held 0.7-meter rangefinder.
Changes
Following the tests, several changes were made. To improve the turning radius and raise the stern at high speed, a stau keel, a short keel with a shallow wedge-shaped cross section, was added below the transom. However, this pushed the bow deeper into the water, exacerbating the lack of forward sheer, splashing the bridge, making the No. 1 gun unworkable, and making the upper deck unsafe to walk on. A more serious problem was the continuous sagging forces on the hull, which necessitated reinforcement of the plates in the middle of the hull to prevent cracking. The stowkills were removed between 1940 and 1942; around 1938-1939, the bows of the four vessels were converted to be more sheer and retractable bow spars were installed, increasing their length to 114.4 m (375 ft) between right angles and 119.3 m (391 ft) in total length, and stabilizers were replaced by a bilge keel. In addition, the upper bridge, which had a rounded front, was reworked to a more square shape to increase the available space. To reduce the top weight, Richard Beitzen lowered the funnel height in 1942.
An active sonar system was scheduled to be installed on Richard Bazen in June 1940, but it is unknown when it was actually installed by this date. During the war, the ship's light anti-aircraft armament was augmented several times. An improved 2 cm C/38 gun replaced the original C/30 gun, and three more guns were added sometime in 1941. The two guns on the rear shelter deck were replaced by four 2cm anti-aircraft guns, probably during a refit at the end of 1941. Richard Beitzen does not appear to have added any additional AA guns after this period; after mid-1941, the ship was fitted with a FuMO 24 search radar and later with a FuMO 63 K Hohentwiel radar.
