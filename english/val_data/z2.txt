The Z2 was a mechanical computer built by Konrad Zuse in Germany between 1939 and 1941. It was an improved version of the Z1, and it was the first fully functional computer in the world.
The Z2 was still a mechanical computer, but it was built using more durable materials, such as steel and aluminum. It was also smaller and lighter than the Z1, weighing about 300 kilograms.
The Z2 was programmed using a punched tape system, like the Z1. However, the Z2's tape system was more advanced, and it allowed for more complex programs.
The Z2 was capable of performing a variety of mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It could also be used to solve equations and to perform other calculations.
The Z2 was a significant achievement, and it was a major step forward in the development of computing. It showed that it was possible to build a fully functional computer that was programmable and that could perform a variety of tasks.
Here are some of the key features of the Z2:
* Programming: The Z2 was programmed using a punched tape system. The tape consisted of a series of holes that represented the instructions for the computer.
* Computation: The Z2 was capable of performing a variety of mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It could also be used to solve equations and to perform other calculations.
* Size and complexity: The Z2 was about the size of a small table, and it weighed about 300 kilograms. It was smaller and lighter than the Z1, and it was more durable.
The Z2 was a significant achievement in the development of computing. It showed that it was possible to build a fully functional computer that was programmable and that could perform a variety of tasks.
The Z2 was used by Zuse to develop a number of important software programs, including a compiler for the Plankalk√ºl programming language. The Z2 was also used to calculate ballistics tables for the German military.
The Z2 was destroyed during World War II, but it was rebuilt by Zuse after the war. The rebuilt Z2 is on display at the Deutsches Museum in Munich, Germany.
