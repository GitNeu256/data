German destroyer Z2 Georg Thiele was one of four Type 1934-class destroyers built for the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) in mid-1930s. She was named after Georg Thiele, who was a Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain) and command of the Seventh Half Flotilla of torpedo boats. Finished in 1937, two years prior to the outbreak of World War II,the ship spent most of her time training although it was involved in the occupation of Memel in early 1939.
At the start of World War II, it was initially dispatched to blockade the Polish coast but was soon transferred into the German Bight to lay minefields in German waters. During the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign in April 1940, Z2 Georg Thiele participated in the naval Battles of Narvik on 10 and 13 April. She was beached and her crew had to abandon ship after being severely damaged by British fire. The damaged boat is now a popular diving site.
Design and Overview
Design work on the Type 34 destroyer began in 1932, when Weimar Germany renounced the arms restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I. The initial design of the new destroyer was intended to be larger and more powerful than the French and Polish destroyers in service at the time, but the design was further developed as the Kriegsmarine came to be expected to serve as a small cruiser. The design work appears to have been rushed and not well thought out, as the short foremast and lack of bow flare compromised the ship's seaworthiness and stability was inadequate. The high-pressure boiler, the only innovation in the design, was an overly complex system that was rarely tested on board before being installed on the Type 34 and frequently failed throughout the life of the ship.
The ship was 119 meters long with a draft line length of 114 meters. The beam was 11.30 meters (37 feet 1 inch) and the maximum draft was 4.23 meters (13 feet 11 inches). Two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft and using steam supplied by six Wagner boilers, produced 70,000 PS (51, 000 The design speed was 36 knots (36 mph).
The design speed was 36 knots (67 km/h), but the actual maximum speed was 38.7 knots (71.7 km/h).Type 34 could carry up to 752 tons (740 t) of fuel oil and could travel 4,400 nautical miles (8,100 km; 5,100 miles) at 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph) The Type 34 class crew consisted of 10 officers and 315 enlisted men, with an additional 4 officers and 19 enlisted men when serving as fleet flagship.
The Type 34 class carried five 12.7cm SK C/34 guns mounted on single gun mounts with gun shields, two each stacked fore and aft; the fifth gun was mounted on top of the aft superstructure. The guns were numbered from one to five from fore to aft. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C/30 guns mounted on a pair of double gun mounts next to the rear funnel, and six 2 cm C/30 guns mounted on a single gun mount. Two 53.3 cm torpedo tubes were mounted. Each rack was equipped with a pair of loaded torpedoes.
Georg Thiele was equipped with four torpedo launchers on the sides of the aft deckhouse and an additional six racks for torpedoes on the aft sides, with a capacity of 32 or 64 torpedoes. The aft deck could be fitted with a mine rail that could carry up to 60 mines; a system of passive hydrophones called "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) was fitted to detect submarines.
Construction and Career
Z2 Georg Thiele was ordered on 7 July 1934 and broken ground on 25 October 1934 at Deutsche Werke, Kiel, under yard number K243; launched on 18 August 1935, completed and commissioned on 27 February 1937; assigned to the 1st Destroyer Division on 1 December 1937. In April 1938, she called at Ulvik, Norway, together with her sisters Z3 Max Schulze and Z4 Richard Beitzen. She was then handed over to her builder, Deutsche Werke, who had her bow modified to repair the damage caused by the large amount of water that came over the bow in a headwind. This increased the overall length by 30 meters. She then participated in the fleet review for Adolf Hitler and Miklós Horthy, Regent of Hungary, on August 22, and in the subsequent fleet exercises. They sailed to Iceland to evaluate her seaworthiness in the North Atlantic winter.
On March 23-24, 1939, she became one of the destroyers escorting the heavily armed cruiser Deutschland transporting Adolf Hitler, who was declaring the occupation of Memel. She participated in spring fleet exercises in the western Mediterranean and made several visits to Spanish and Moroccan ports in April and May. When World War II broke out, Georg Thiele was initially deployed to the Baltic Sea to enforce the Polish blockade against the Polish Navy, but was soon transferred to the Gulf of Germany, where she and her sisters laid defensive minefields; her refit began in late 1939 and was completed in early April 1940.
The Norwegian Campaign
Georg Thiele was assigned to Group 1 in April 1940 for the Norwegian campaign of Operation Weselübung. The group's mission was to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment (139. Gebirgsjäger Regiment) and the headquarters of the 3rd Mountain Division (3. Gebirgs-Division) to occupy Narvik. The ships began loading troops on April 6 and departed the following day. The German destroyers arrived at Offotfjord on the morning of April 9, and Admiral Friedrich Bonte headed down the fjord to Narvik with his flagship Wilhelm Heitkamp, Georg Thiele, and Z11 Bernd von Arnim. Despite a heavy snowstorm, Thiele and von Arnim were able to enter the port without difficulty and dock at the pier.
The mountain troops immediately began disembarking, but were spotted a few minutes later by the coastal defense ship Norge. The latter ship immediately opened fire and was able to fire about 13 21cm shells at a range of 600 to 800 meters before von Arnim was able to sink the Norwegian ship with a torpedo. Despite the darkness and falling snow and the short range, the Norwegian shells did not hit either of the two destroyers.
Thiele and von Arnim were the first ships to refuel from the one tanker that arrived safely at Narvik and then moved to Balangenfjord, south of Ofotfjord, near the entrance. before dawn on April 10, five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, HMS Hardy, HMS Havoc, HMS Hunter, HMS Hotspur, and HMS Hero, surprised five German destroyers in Narvik harbor. They hit two of the destroyers with torpedoes and inflicted heavy damage on the other three.
As they began their retreat, they encountered three destroyers of the Fourth Fleet, which had been on alert at Herjangsfjord when the British launched their attack. The Germans opened fire first, but fog and the smoke screen the British had laid as they retreated up Offotfjord made the bombardment by both sides ineffective. The German ships had to turn away to avoid a salvo of three torpedoes fired by one of the destroyers at Narvik, but Thiele and von Arnim were also on alert and were moving closer to engage the British. The two German destroyers were able to cross the T of the British fleet and open full port fire at a distance of only 4,000 meters (13,000 feet). They first engaged the British flagship HMS Hardy, inflicting heavy damage on her. Both of her forward guns were destroyed and her forward superstructure caught fire. Hardy was forced to sink herself to avoid sinking, and the Germans switched their fire to the next ship, HMS Havoc. Its fire was relatively ineffective, and both sides fired torpedoes but failed to hit. Havoc withdrew and fell back to the rear to repel the pursuit of the fourth fleet. This left HMS Hunter in the lead, which was quickly set on fire by the German ships.
HMS Hunter, which Thiele believed had been hit by a torpedo, was rammed from behind by HMS Hotspur, which lost steering. Hotspur was able to break away, but Hunter capsized shortly after. The three remaining British ships were able to escape the Germans behind a smoke screen. Georg Thiele was hit seven times and badly damaged. British shells destroyed her forward guns and fire control equipment, flooded one magazine, started a fire, and killed 13 crewmen.
During the night of April 12-13, Commander Erich Boe, the surviving senior German officer, was informed that an attack by the main British ship, escorted by a number of destroyers and supported by carrier-based aircraft, was expected the next day. Thiele was still under repair and at this point had only four usable guns and six torpedoes left. The battleship Warspite and nine destroyers showed up on April 13, earlier than Bay had expected, and broke the Germans' hold. Five operational destroyers, including Thiele, charged out of Narvik harbor and engaged the British ships, but without significant success.
Lacking ammunition, the German ships were forced to retreat to Lombaksfjorden (the easternmost tributary of Offotfjord) east of Narvik, where they attempted to ambush the pursuing British destroyers. Thiele still had ammunition and torpedoes left, and she and Z18 Hans Rüdemann took up position at the Straumen narrows, giving the two remaining destroyers time to take cover at the fjord's head.
The pursuing British destroyers initially engaged Rüdemann, but Rüdemann ran out of ammunition and retreated to the head of the fjord. The British destroyer then turned its attention to Thiele. The German torpedo blew off the bow of the Eskimo and Thiele took the first hit, but the British ship's counterattack caused several fires and severe damage to the ship, so captain Korvettenkapitän Max-Eckart Wolff, the crew of the ordered the ship to run aground so that it could be safely abandoned. Fourteen people were killed in the battle and another 28 were wounded.
The surviving crew members participated in land battles at Narvik in the following weeks. Wolff served as battalion commander of the Berger Marine Regiment during the land battle. He was awarded the Iron Cross, First Class, on May 12, 1940, and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross the following August for his command of the Thiele at Narvik. The ship then broke in half and capsized.
Today, the wreck is one of Narvik's most popular dive sites. It was also featured in the documentary series Abandoned Engineering, Season 2 Episode 7, "Germany's Lost Warship".
