Etymology
The word "Honkai" is derived from the Japanese word for "collapse," which is a literal translation of the original Chinese word "bēng huài" in the original title. The "impact" part of the title is absent in both the Chinese and Japanese versions, and is used only in the English marketing.
In the game, the term "Honkai Impact" (also "Honkai Eruption" or "Honkai Outbreak") refers to the massive Honkai disaster that occurs upon the birth of Hellshire.
Gameplay
In Honkai Impact 3rd, players control a team of up to three characters, called Valkyries, who engage in real-time combat with a variety of enemies. During battle, players can freely switch between characters and move around the battlefield. Each Valkyrie has unique attacks, evasion, switches, ultimate skills, and types. Mech, bio-logic, and psychic types are based on a rock-paper-scissors system, with advantage and disadvantage depending on the enemy's type and one's own type. Two additional types, Quantum and Imaginary, are at odds with each other, neutral to the above three types and favorable to themselves. A Valkyrie's status and skills can be altered by various weapons and equipment, and can be improved by using in-game resources. New equipment (called stigmata), weapons, and Valkyries can be obtained through in-game crafting or the gacha system.
Single-player game modes include a story campaign consisting of stages separated by cutscenes and full-motion video (FMV) dialogue, Chronicle, a series of short side stories that explore the Valkyries' backstory and other aspects of the world, and Open World, which allows players to explore several large open-ended fields to collect materials and complete various challenge tasks.
The game offers a variety of multiplayer cooperative and competitive modes. For example, there is "Co-op Raid," in which players team up to progress through several stages to obtain legendary weapons and related rewards; "Memorial Arena," in which players compete for the highest score across the server; and "Abyss," in which a small group of players compete with other players for high scores and challenges in a series of trials. Players can join groups of other players, called armadas, for more events and rewards. Armadas can request materials and resources from other players in the armada on a limited basis.
Outside of battles, "Honkai Impact 3rd" allows players to interact with Valkyrie and Stigmata characters through the dormitory mode. Completing character-specific tasks will allow another character to move into the dormitory, where they can view new character information and conversations between characters. Players can craft various pieces of furniture and design the layout of their dorm rooms to increase the "comfort" level of the Valkyries and Stigmata in them. As the comfort level increases, dormitory restrictions also level up, allowing for more elaborate decorations. Players can visit and see each other's decorated dorm layouts. Secondary gameplay mechanisms include a variety of mini-games that incorporate elements of bullet games, platform games, and shooters, allowing players to collect various crafting materials and experience. Limited-time seasonal events may also include gameplay styles not normally found in the main gameplay mode, such as dungeon crawling and battle royale.
Weapons.
Each Valkyrie can equip one type of weapon. The types of weapons in the game are: two pistols, blade (katana), heavy (cannon), two-handed sword (greatsword), cross, fist (gauntlet), scythe, lance, bow, chakram, and javelin.
Players can obtain weapons through store purchases, crafting, and the gacha system. Once a player has acquired a weapon, he or she can upgrade the weapon to enhance its attribute effects.
At player level 50 and weapon level 50, some weapons can be upgraded to PRI-ARM to change their design, attributes, and effects. However, the maximum level of the weapon cannot be increased until the player level reaches 81.
Stigmata
Each Valkyrie can equip three stigmata. They can increase attack power, defense power, critical probability, and other attribute effects.
Stigmata are divided into upper, middle, and lower sections, corresponding to attack, defense, and assistance, respectively. In addition, two or three of the same sacrament can be worn to activate different set effects. Players can obtain sacraments through gacha, clearing stages, events, crafting, etc. After obtaining a sacrament, players can enhance, upgrade, and refine it to improve its status and effects.
Item Enhancement
Players can enhance (level up) weapons and stigmata to improve the status of their Valkyries. Stigmata require a different EXP item type than weapons to level up. By strengthening them, better attribute effect bonuses can be obtained.
Leveling Up Items
Players can level up their weapons and stigmata to improve the attribute effects of their equipment. All weapons and sacraments can be upgraded to star level through upgrades. After upgrading, the level limit will be increased and the effects will be more powerful. More advanced weapons and sacraments require more advanced upgrade materials. Upgrade materials can be obtained by challenging stages, pulling gachas, or purchasing them in the store.
Currency
The main currencies are crystals and coins, which can be obtained in a variety of ways other than premium. Asterite is a currency that can be obtained from various locations throughout the game and can be exchanged for consumable items in certain stores. Many of the gameplay modes and events have their own corresponding currencies and stores.
