The German destroyer Z1 Leberecht Maas was the flagship of a class of four destroyers built in the mid-1930s for the German Navy (originally called Reichsmarine and renamed Kriegsmarine in 1935). Completed in 1937, two years before the start of World War II, she served as the flagship and spent most of her time in training before taking part in the occupation of Memel in early 1939.
A few days after the outbreak of war in September 1939, Z1 Leberecht Maas and another destroyer attacked a Polish ship at a naval base on the Hel Peninsula, but were unsuccessful. The ship was lightly damaged in this action; in mid-February 1940, while sailing in the North Sea to attack a British fishing trawler (Operation Wikinger), she was bombed by German bombers on patrol, damaging her steering. After the attack, Z1 Leberecht Maas broke in half and sank with the loss of most of her crew. A board of inquiry convened during the war determined that bombs had hit the ship and her sister ships, but postwar investigations determined that the ship had drifted into a newly laid British minefield.
Design and Description
Design work on the Type 34 destroyer began in 1932, despite the 800-ton (810-ton) limit imposed by the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I. The original design envisioned a larger ship, more powerful than the French and Polish destroyers in service at the time, but the design was expanded as the Imperial Navy came to expect her to serve as a small cruiser. The design appears to have been rushed, with the short forward bow and lack of flares compromising the ship's seaworthiness and making it inadequately stable. The high-pressure boiler, the only innovation in the design, was an overly complex system that was rarely tested on board before being installed on the Type 34 and frequently failed throughout the ship's life.
The ship was 119 meters long with a draft line length of 114 meters. The beam was 11.30 meters (37 feet 1 inch) and the maximum draft was 4.23 meters (13 feet 11 inches). Two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft and using steam supplied by six Wagner boilers, produced 70,000 PS (51, 000 The design speed was 36 knots (36 mph). The design speed was 36 knots (67 km/h), but maximum speed was 38.7 knots (71.7 km/h).Type 34 was designed to carry up to 752 tons (740 t) of fuel oil and a range of 4,400 nautical miles (8,100 km; 5,100 miles) at 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph) was envisioned, but she proved to be top-heavy when commissioned, and 30% of her fuel had to be held as ballast low in the ship. Effective range was found to be only 1,530 nautical miles (2,830 km; 1,760 miles) at 19 knots, and the Type 34 class crew consisted of 10 officers and 315 petty officers, with an additional four officers and 19 petty officers when serving as fleet flagships.
The Type 34 class carried five 12.7cm SK C/34 guns mounted on single gun mounts with gun shields, two each stacked fore and aft; the fifth gun was mounted on top of the aft superstructure. The guns were numbered from one to five from fore to aft. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C/30 guns mounted on a pair of double gun mounts next to the rear funnel, and six 2 cm C/30 guns mounted on a single gun mount. Two 53.3 cm torpedo tubes were mounted. Each rack was equipped with a pair of loaded torpedoes. Leberecht Maas carried four detonator launchers on the sides of the aft deckhouse and an additional six detonator racks on the sides of the stern, for a total of 32 or 64 torpedoes. The aft deck could be fitted with mine rails that could carry up to 60 mines. To detect submarines, a system of passive hydrophones called "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) was fitted.
Construction and Career
Ordered on 7 July 1934 and broken ground on 10 October 1934 at Deutsche Werke in Kiel as yard number K232, she was launched on 18 August 1935 and completed on 14 January 1937 under the command of Commander Friedrich T. Schmitt.
The first of the class of ships to be completed, Leberecht Maas became the flagship of Torpedo Boat Command (FdT) on 1 May, and spent most of her first year training in the eastern Baltic Sea before calling at Gothenburg, Sweden, in early April 1938. She then called at Gothenburg, Sweden, in early April 1938. After returning to port, the ship was handed over to the builder and the bow was modified to fix the large amount of water on the bow due to headwinds. She then participated in the August 1938 fleet review and the following fleet exercises; in October, Korwettenkapiten Gerhard Wagner relieved Schmidt; in December, Leberecht Maas, together with her sisters Z2 Georg Thiele, Z3 Max Schulze, and Z4 Richard Bezuyen, joined the new On March 23-24, 1939, the ship occupied Memel with the heavy cruiser Deutschland as one of the destroyers escorting Adolf Hitler. The following month, Korvettenkapitän Fritz Bassenge assumed command of the Leberecht Maass. She then participated in fleet exercises in the western Mediterranean under the flagship of Admiral Günther Lützen, and visited Ceuta and Ria de Arousa, Spain, before sailing for Germany on May 13.
When Hitler declared war on Poland on September 1, Kriegsmarine's first mission was to blockade the Polish coast. To accomplish this task, he deployed three light cruisers and ten destroyers, including the Leberecht Maass. Leberecht Maass evaded an attack by the submarine ORP Wilk on the first day of the war. It soon became apparent that the German Navy had deployed too many ships to the Polish coast and the cruisers were withdrawn; two days later, the ship and Z9 Wolfgang Zenker were ordered to survey the ships at the naval base in Hel. They spotted the Polish destroyer Wicher and the minesweeper Griff and engaged both ships at a distance of about 12,700 meters (13,900 yards). The German fire was ineffective, but the Polish return fire was more precise, forcing the German destroyers to take evasive action and to set up a smoke screen to throw off the Polish gunners' aim. At 06:57, the Leberecht Maas was hit by a 152mm shell from the shore defense battery protecting the base, which knocked out power to the second gun and disabled the shell winder, killing four crewmen and wounding four more. The ship fired 77 rounds of 12.7 cm shells during the battle. The next day, the ship went to Svinemünde to repair the damage, which included repairing the boiler tubes, a task that took until September 10. After repairs were completed, Leberecht Maas assisted in laying defensive minefields in the North Sea, Lütchens transferred her flag to Z21 Wilhelm Heitkamp, and the ship was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 2. On 29 September, she began her scheduled refit at Svinemünde, and on 30 November she again became flagship of FdT, but On December 22, she rejoined Destroyer Squadron 2. On February 16, 1940, in retaliation for the Altmark Incident, in which the Royal Navy captured captured British sailors from the German tanker Altmark in neutral Norwegian waters, the German Navy organized Operation Nordmark, a search for Allied merchant ships in the North Sea to the Shetland Islands.2. The Zellsterer Flotilla, including Raberecht Maas, escorted the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper during the initial stages of their sortie on February 18, but Raberecht Maas and Z5 Paul Jacobi left the next day to search for enemy ships in Skagerrak and failed.
A few days later, the German Navy, in cooperation with the Luftwaffe, planned Operation Wikinger, based on the mistaken belief that British fishing boats off the Dogger Bank were cooperating with the submarines. They believed that by sinking or capturing the trawlers, the British would be forced to spread themselves thin to protect their fishing fleet, which might result in useful auxiliary vessels for the German marines. The Luftwaffe promised fighter cover and bomber support for the ships engaged in this operation.
Leberecht Maas and five other destroyers (Max Schulze, Richard Beitzen, Z6 Theodor Riedel, Z13 Erich Kellner, and Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt) set sail on February 22. En route, the convoy was misfired by a Heinkel He 111 bomber of Kampfgeschwader 26. The Leberecht Maas was hit by at least one bomb, lost its steering, was cut in half, and sank with the loss of 280 crew members, including the captain. Only 60 of the crew survived. During the rescue operation, Max Schulze struck a mine and sank with the loss of her entire crew. Hitler ordered the convening of a commission of inquiry to determine the cause, which concluded that both ships had been sunk by He 111 bombs. The German Navy did not inform the destroyers that the Luftwaffe was conducting anti-ship patrols at the time, nor did they inform the Luftwaffe that the destroyers were at sea. Postwar investigations revealed that one or two ships may have struck the British minefield laid by the destroyers Ivanhoe and Intrepid.
