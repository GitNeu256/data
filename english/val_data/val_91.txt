Altair, a 3D design and simulation software developer based in Michigan, has acquired SIMSOLID, a CAD software company developing simulation technology for designers, engineers, and simulation analysts. “We believe SIMSOLID is a revolutionary technological breakthrough which will have a profound impact for product design. It’s incredibly fast, accurate, and robust and we believe a game changer for our industry,” explained James Scapa, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Altair. SIMSOLID is structural analysis software which can be used to simulate complex additively manufactured lattice structures. The technology is said to “eliminate geometry simplification and meshing, the two most time-consuming and expertise extensive, and error-prone tasks done in traditional Finite Element Analysis (FEA).” “Others have tried to accelerate the interface between CAD and simulation by degrading the mathematical robustness,” said Dr. Uwe Schramm, Chief Technical Officer of Altair. “It is our feeling that by rapidly moving forward with the methods in SIMSOLID and expanding them across applications we can have a real effect on how design gets done while maintaining our high standards for computational excellence.” Earlier this year, Altair launched a start-up program to allow business’ access to its suite of solutions for digital design simulation, computer-aided engineering (CAE), cloud computing and the Internet of Things. Following this, Altair entered into a partnership with Renishaw, to operate a line of projects aimed at introducing additive manufacturing to serial end-use production. Last year, Altair added Additive Works’ Amphyon program, the simulation of powder bed based 3D printing processes, to its HyperWorks software suite. This 3D design software was previously used to design the APWorks Light Rider motorcycle.
