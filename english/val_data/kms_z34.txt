Z34 was a 1936A destroyer built for the German Navy during World War II.She was completed in 1943 and spent time in Norwegian waters until 1944, when she was damaged twice by British aircraft attacking the battleship Tirpitz. When the Germans began evacuating northern Norway in October, she escorted a convoy of troops from northern Norway; Z34 was transferred to the Baltic Sea with two sister ships in early 1945 and participated in action when she was intercepted by two British light cruisers off Norway on January 28, 1945. The ship sustained only minor damage in the battle and all three destroyers were able to break away.
In the months that followed, the ship escorted evacuation convoys and German cruisers in their bombardment of the Soviet positions. She also attacked the Soviets with her own guns.Z34 was wrecked by a Soviet torpedo in mid-April and towed into port for emergency repairs; in early May, she was sufficient to carry the refugees and detached troops to Denmark. After the war, she was turned over to the Allies in Germany and assigned to the U.S. in the division of the remaining German naval vessels; still not fully repaired from her torpedo hit in 1945, she was scrapped in early 1946.
Design and Description
The Type 1936A (Mob) destroyers were slightly larger and heavier armed than the preceding Type 1936A class. Its overall length was 127 meters (416 feet 8 inches) and its length at the draft line was 121.9 meters (399 feet 11 inches). The beam was 12 meters (39 feet 4 inches) and the maximum draft was 4.62 meters (15 feet 2 inches). Two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, used steam supplied by six Wagner water tube boilers to produce 70,000 PS ( 51,000 kW; 69,000 shp) was designed to be generated. The design speed was 36 knots (67 km/h) and the maximum speed was 36.1 knots (66.9 km/h).The Type 1936A (mob) destroyers carried enough fuel oil to give a range of 2,239 nautical miles (4,147 km; 2,577 miles) at 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph). The ship had a Her crew consisted of 11 to 15 officers and 305 to 21 enlisted men, with an additional four officers and 19 enlisted men when serving as fleet flagship.
The armament of the 1936A (mob) ships consisted of five 15 cm TbtsK C/36 guns mounted in a series turret forward and three in a single turret with gun shield aft of the main superstructure. Antiaircraft armament varied, with the Z34 carrying four 3.7cm Flak M42 guns in a pair of linked turrets next to the rear funnel and ten 2cm C/38 guns in two quadruple turrets and two single turrets. The torpedo launchers were two 53.3 cm torpedo tubes. Each rack was equipped with a pair of loading torpedoes. Aft deck was fitted with a mine track capable of carrying up to 60 mines. a passive underwater listening device called a "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) was fitted to detect submarines. a S-Gerät sonar was probably also fitted. a "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) was fitted to detect submarines. The upper bridge was equipped with a FuMO 24/25 radar and a FuMB 34 radar detector.
Alterations
From 1944 to 1945, a FuMO 63 Hohentwiel radar replaced the aft searchlight; before 31 March 1945, a pair of 8.6 cm RaG anti-aircraft rocket launchers were fitted. By the end of the war, the Z34's light anti-aircraft gun armament consisted of one to three 4cm guns, six 3.7cm guns, and 16 2cm guns.
Commissioning History
The Z34 was ordered on June 28, 1939 from Seebeckwerft (shipyard number 666) as a Type 1938B destroyer, but the German Navy cancelled the order in September 1939 and reordered her on September 19, 1939 from AG Weser (Desimag) (shipyard number W1004) as a Type 1936A (Mob) destroyer The order was re-ordered as. The ship was broken ground at the Bremen shipyard in Decimag on January 14, 1941, and launched on May 15, 1942. Construction was delayed due to lack of manpower and materials, and Z34 was not commissioned until June 5, 1943.
She sailed for Norway immediately after work was completed on November 1. The following month, on 25 December, she was one of the escorts of the battleship Scharnhorst in Operation Ostfront, and attempted to intercept the British convoy JW 55B bound for the Soviet Union. The entire escort of the battleship Scharnhorst was detached the next day to improve the chances of intercepting the convoy and did not participate in the ensuing Battle of the North Cape Z34 remained in the Arctic Circle throughout 1944 to protect the damaged battleship Tirpitz Z34 was bombed by the British on July 17 and August 29. Damaged, the crew helped extinguish a fire on the oil tanker SS C. A. Larsen during the latter attack; from October, she escorted convoys in Operation Nordlicht (evacuation of northern Norway); on 1 December, she towed a troop transport damaged in Hammerfest, headed directly for Tromsø, where she was refitted on the 11th, On the 11th, she began refitting; on 22 January 1945, Z31, Z34, and Z38 laid minefields at Magerøya, Larfjord, and Breisaunds.
On January 25, the three destroyers departed Tromsø for the Baltic Sea. Three days later, off Sognefjord, they were intercepted by the British fleet, including the light cruisers Diadem and Mauritius. In the ensuing action on January 28, Z31 suffered heavy losses, and the lightly wounded Z34 repeatedly torpedoed the cruiser to cover Z31's retreat, but to no avail. With a smoke-filled retreat, the fast destroyer was able to outflank the cruisers and take refuge in Aspofjord, protected by German coastal artillery; Z34 suffered only minor damage during the engagement and transported 200 artillerymen from Kiel to Gottenhafen on February 3. A week later, it escorted the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer as she shelled Soviet positions near Frauenburg in support of the Fourth Army. In the months that followed, the Z34 evacuated evacuees from Kolberg, escorted the heavy cruisers Admiral Scheier, Lützow, and Prinz Eugen on bombardment missions, and bombarded Dievenow and Torchemito. In the former, it destroyed 12 tanks and 4 anti-tank guns; on March 29, it was lightly damaged by Soviet aircraft. Two days later, the Z34 became the first German ship to engage aircraft with rockets.
In early April, she escorted the ocean liners Deutschland and Pretoria, which were carrying 17,000 refugees to Copenhagen, Denmark; Z34 began a brief refit at Svinemünde on April 4, and on April 10 she shelled Soviet positions near Grossendorf. During a decisive battle against a Soviet coastal battery at Oxhoft, a 15cm shell exploded prematurely in the barrel, destroying the gun. The gun was replaced by a weapon taken from a decommissioned Z33. On her way back to Hera after another escort mission, she was attacked by two Soviet motor torpedo boats on the night of April 15 and 16. one torpedo was avoided, but she was hit by another torpedo. The hit torpedo flooded the aft turbine room, causing both turbines to fail and knocking out all power. The next day, Z34 was attacked by Soviet aircraft while drifting, and an anti-aircraft rocket exploded on deck, killing eight crew members and wounding 14. Towed by torpedo boat T36 and minesweeper M204, the ship entered Svinemünde and underwent emergency repairs. She also augmented her light anti-aircraft armament with weapons taken from the wreckage of Lützow, arrived at Copenhagen on 4 May with a full load of refugees, and was decommissioned at Kiel on 10 May.
Z34s were assigned to the United States when the Allies partitioned the remaining German navy ships in late 1945. Due to the poor state of repair, the U.S. Navy decided against using the ship, and on March 26, 1946, it was sunk in Scagarac with its cargo of chemical ammunition.
