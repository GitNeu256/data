The Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) was a variant of SARS-CoV-2 of concern. Estimated to be 40-80% more infectious than wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (most estimates are in the middle to upper end of this range), scientists focused on this variant in early December 2020 when a phylogenetic tree showing the virus sequence in Kent, England, appeared unusual. This variant began to spread rapidly by mid-December, about the same time that the number of infected individuals increased rapidly.
This increase is thought to be due, at least in part, to one or more mutations in the virus' spike protein. This variant was also characterized by more mutations than normally seen.
By January 2021, more than half of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing had been done in the UK. This raised the question of how many other important variants were going around the world undetected.
On February 2, 2021, Public Health England reported "detection of a limited number of B.1.1.7 VOC-202012/01 genomes with the E484K mutation," which they named the mutation of concern 202102/02 (VOC-202102/02)  One of the mutations (N501Y) is also present in the beta and gamma mutants.
On May 31, 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that this "variant of concern" would be labeled "alpha variant".
Classification
Name
This variant is known by several names. Outside the UK, it is sometimes referred to as the British variant, British variant, or British variant, despite the existence of other, less common variants that were first identified in the UK, such as the Eta variant (strain B.1.525). Within the UK, it is commonly referred to as the Kent variant, after the county of Kent where it was discovered.
In scientific use, this variant was originally named the first Variant Under Investigation (VUI - 202012/01) by Public Health England (PHE) in December 2020, but PHE published a December 21, 2020 Reclassified as Variant of Concern (Variant of Concern 202012/01, abbreviated VOC-202012/01) by Meera Chand et al. in a report written on behalf of the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium In the report, Andrew Rambaut and his co-authors, using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages (pangolin) tool, named it lineage B.1.1.7 and Nextstrain has named this mutant was named 20I/501Y.V1.
The designation VOC-202102/02 refers to the mutant with the E484K mutation (see below).
Gene profile
According to the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 are common, with over 4,000 mutations detected in the spike protein alone.
VOC-202012/01 is defined by 23 mutations: 14 nonsynonymous mutations, 3 deletions, and 6 synonymous mutations (i.e., 17 mutations that alter the protein and 6 that do not).
Symptoms and Signs.
Imperial College London studied more than one million people in England during the period when the alpha form was predominant and found a variety of symptoms associated with cobid. Chills, loss of appetite, headache, and muscle aches were the most common among those infected, with classic symptoms also present.
Diagnosis
Rapid antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 are widely used worldwide to diagnose COVID-19. These tests are believed to be useful in stopping the chain of transmission of the virus by providing a rapid means of identifying large numbers of infected individuals as part of a population testing program, although after the advent of VOC-202012/01 there were initial concerns that the rapid tests might not detect it, Public Health England determined that the variant was detected by the rapid tests evaluated and used in the United Kingdom.
Prevention
By late 2020, several COVID-19 vaccines had been introduced or were in development.
However, as further mutations occurred, there was concern about whether vaccine development would need to change; SARS-CoV-2, for example, does not mutate as quickly as the influenza virus, and any new vaccine proven effective by the end of 2020 would be of a type that could be adjusted as needed The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is a new vaccine that is not as fast mutating as the influenza virus, for example. As of the end of 2020, health authorities and experts in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States believe that existing vaccines are as effective against VOC-202012/01 as the previous variants.
On December 18, NERVTAG decided that "there are currently insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding antigenic escapes".
As of December 20, 2020, Public Health England confirmed that "no evidence" suggests that the new strain is resistant to the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine currently used in the UK vaccination program and that people should still be protected.
E484K Mutation
On February 2, 2021, Public Health England reported "detection of a limited number of B.1.1.7 VOC-202012/01 genomes with the E484K mutation. "On February 9, 2021, 76 cases with the E484K mutation were detected, mainly in Bristol, but also in Liverpool, where genomic different groups were found to carry the mutation. A week later, an investigation and analysis report released by PHE showed a total of 77 confirmed and probable cases of the E484K mutation throughout the UK, with two variants, VUI-202102/01 and VOC-202102/02, the latter described as "B.1.1.7 with E484K" The latter was listed as "B.1.1.7 with E484K".
On March 5, 2021, it was reported that the B.1.1.7 lineage with the E484K mutation had been detected in two patients in the United States (Oregon and New York). The researchers believe that the variant E484K mutation in Oregon arose independently.
Transmissibility.
The transmissibility of the Alpha variant (strain B.1.1.7) was generally found to be considerably higher than the existing SARS-CoV-2 variant. This variant was discovered by a team of COG-UK scientists, whose initial results showed that the transmission rate was 70% (50-100%) higher. Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine The study found that this variant was 43-90% (95% confidence interval range, 38-130%) more infectious than the existing variant in the UK, and the B.1.1.7 strain was similarly infectious in Denmark, Switzerland, and the US. Furthermore, a simple model to explain the rapid increase of the B.1.1.7 strain in several countries and worldwide showed that the variant was 50% more transmissible than the local wild type in these three countries and worldwide. Another study concluded that it was 75% (70%-80%) more transmissible in the UK between October and November 2020. Later studies suggested that these initial estimates overestimated the transmissibility of this variant and that the increase in transmissibility was at the lower end of these ranges.
Based on genome sequencing of positive cases, the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport calculated weekly infection rates of the variant compared to the local wild type and found that these rates varied between 28% and 47% during the first six weeks of 2021. In contrast, the Danish Statens Serum Institut calculated that Denmark is 55% (48%-62%) more likely to be infected based on the relative frequency trends observed from January 4 to February 12, 2021. The Institute for Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM) at the University of Bern calculated the transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 strain based on weekly changes in the percentage of Covid-19 positive individuals observed throughout the pandemic, under the assumptions of wild-type reproduction number Rwâ‰ˆ1 and exponential generation time 5.2 days, with a 95% confidence interval The propagation potential was obtained: 52% (45%-60%) when compared to the Danish wild type and 51% (42%-60%) when compared to the Swiss wild type.
