The performance is created basing on paintings of a watercolour master Benjaminas Jenčius. The creative team has tried to look at art not visually but though states of mind. Benjaminas’ works, which are full of penetrating premonitions, balance between stillness and a frenzied storm. During the performance, the actors look for an intangible substance which is able to melt all fears, complexes and pain, and the souls pulsate by the same rhythm if only for a moment. It is a performance according to a short story by Upton Sinclair The Jungle written in1906. The life of the emigrant families who work in Chicago slaughterhouses at the beginning of the twentieth century is shown as a completely unique environment – a closed, intimidated community forced to unconditionally obey their employers and managers — boiled with passion and vileness. The main character Jurgis Rutkus works in the slaughterhouse, where, according to the author, only pig squeal is not used. He clings to life and puts on the market all his values in order to create a “good” life for his family. The action takes place in Dubingiai, at the Radzwill family manor, where Barbara Radziwill, after her Secret wedding to Sigismund Augustus (1547), lived for half a year in suspense and loneliness under guidance of a doctor-butler Stanislaw Davaina and her brother Radziwill Brown. In 1548, after the death of Sigismund the Old, Barbara was invited to Vilnius and presented to the Lithuanian aristocracy as a legitimate wife of Sigismund Augustus and Queen of Lithuania and Poland. The Coco Secret is a performance about the legendary celebrity of the fashion world Coco Chanel. She was a provocative personality who did not reconcile with the routine life. Helped by her talent and wisdom, she rose from the abyss of poverty to the World of Elite, created most extraordinary stories about herself and became widely known for her “flying expressions” which are still used by us… The artists and nearly a hundred actors possessing a peculiar way of thinking create a unique musical street theatre play expressing experience and beliefs accumulated in mythology and folklore throughout centuries. The story and its atmosphere are created with help of dynamics of fire and water, masks, live music, body plastic, a water screen, lasers and fireworks. The creators’ goal is to present an exciting and impressive performance of an outdoor theatre through a combination of poetic and visual language.
