Z25 was one of 15 Type 1936A destroyers built for the German Navy during World War II. completed in 1940, she spent most of the war in Norwegian waters, escorting German ships and laying minefields. to escort two battleships and one heavy cruiser out of the English Channel; in 1941-1942, she was active in attacking Arctic convoys carrying war materials to the Soviet Union, but only contributed to the sinking of one Allied ship.
Engine trouble in 1943 limited her activities, and after repairs were completed, she was transferred to the Baltic in early 1944. z25 spent most of the remainder of the war escorting ships during the German evacuation of East Prussia and bombarding Soviet forces. she was captured by the allies in May 1945, and the allied forces captured German ships and spent time under British control while the Allies decided how to dispose of them.
She was finally transferred to France in early 1946 and renamed Hoche. Operational from the end of that year, she cruised the French colonies in Africa in 1947, was placed in reserve in early 1949, and converted to a fast destroyer escort between 1950 and 1953; by 1956, the aging Hoche was deemed too expensive to repair and was decommissioned later that year. She was decommissioned in 1958 and scrapped in 1961.
The Type 1936A destroyers were slightly larger and heavier armed than the preceding Type 1936 class. Its overall length was 127 meters (416 feet 8 inches) and its length at the draft line was 121.90 meters (399 feet 11 inches). The beam was 12 meters (39 feet 4 inches) and the maximum draft was 4.43 meters (14 feet 6 inches). Two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving a single propeller shaft, were capable of producing 70,000 PS (51, 000 kW, 69,000 tons) using steam supplied by six Wagner water tube boilers. The Z25 was designed to generate 70,000 kW (51, 000 kW, 69,000 shp) and had a design speed of 36 knots (67 km/h, 41 mph). z25 could carry up to 791 tons (779 long tons) of fuel oil and travel 2,500 nautical miles (4,600 km, 2, 900 miles) at 19 knots (35 km/h, 22 mph). 900 miles) range. The crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors.
She carried four 15 cm TbtsK C/36 guns, one forward of the superstructure and three aft, in single gun mounts with gun shields. From fore to aft there were Nos. 1 to 4. Antiaircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm C/30 guns mounted in double mounts next to the aft funnel and five 2 cm C/30 guns in single mounts; the Z25 carried eight overwater 53.3 cm torpedo tubes on two powered mounts. Two reloads were provided on each mount. The aft deck was also equipped with a mine track that could carry up to 60 mines. A "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) passive hydrophone was fitted to detect submarines, possibly with S-Gerät sonar. The upper bridge was equipped with a FuMO 24/25 radar.
Modifications
Z25's forward 15cm single gun was replaced by a 15cm LC/38 turret in a mid-1942 conversion. This worsened the Type 36A's tendency to land on her bow and reduced her speed to 32.8 knots (60.7 km/h, 37.7 mph); the third gun was later removed to make room for an additional AA gun under the 1944 Barbara program. By the end of the war, the ship's anti-aircraft system consisted of 10 3.7cm guns, single and double, and 16 2cm guns, double and quadruple; most, if not all, of the 3.7cm guns were of the faster-firing Flak M42 type.
The FuMO 21 radar replaced the FuMO 24/25 in 1944, and the FuMB 1 Metox, FuMB 3 Bali, and FuMB 6 Palau radar detectors were added that year. The aircraft was equipped with. History of commissioning
Z25 was ordered from AG Weser (Deschimag) on April 23, 1938; she was broken ground on February 15, 1939 at the Bremen shipyard in Deschimag under yard number W959, launched on March 16, 1940, and commissioned on November 30, 1940; she completed construction on June 26, 1941 and sailed for Norway Z25 was assigned to escort the Baltic Fleet, which was temporarily formed around the battleship Tirpitz, and from September 23 to 29, she was assigned to escort the Soviet Union's red-flag Baltic Fleet in its attempt to escape from the Gulf of Finland. From September 23 to 29, she sailed into the Åland Sea to thwart attempts by the Soviet red-flag Baltic Fleet to escape from the Gulf of Finland.
Two months later, Z25, along with her sister ships Z23 and Z27, sailed from Germany to Norway, arriving in Tromsø on December 6. Upon arrival in Kirkenes, she replaced Z26 as the flagship of fleet commander Hans Erdmenger (captain), and on December 16, 1941, she led her sister ships Z23, Z24, and Z27 out to the Barents Sea to search for Allied warships off the Kola Peninsula. The next day, Z25's radar spotted the two ships at a distance of 37.5 kilometers (23.3 miles) in a thick fog. The Germans thought they were Soviet destroyers, but in fact they were two British minesweepers, Hazard and Speedy, which were sailing to rendezvous with Convoy QP 6. The Germans intercepted them but could not fire accurately due to thick fog and icing; Z25 and Z27 attempted to fire 11 torpedoes but could only fire one each; on 13 January 1942, Z25 escorted Z23 and Z24 to lay minefields in the West Channel of the White Sea.
On the 29th, Z25 departed Kirkenes and rendezvoused with destroyer Z7 Hermann Schoeman at Vlissingen, Netherlands. The German ships departed Brest on February 11, much to the surprise of the British. During the sporadic attacks by the British, Z25 never engaged or suffered any damage from British ships or aircraft. Shortly thereafter, Z25, along with four destroyers, escorted the heavy cruisers Prinz Eugen and Admiral Scheer to Trondheim. Due to bad weather, three of the destroyers were forced to return to port before reaching their destination, and the Prinz Eugen was wrecked by a British submarine after separation.
Anti-Destroyer Operations
On March 6, Tirpitz, escorted by Z25 and three other destroyers, sailed to attack the returning Convoy QP 8 and the Russia-bound PQ 12 as part of Operation Sportpalast (Sports Palace). The next morning, Admiral Otto Syriacs, commanding the operation, ordered the destroyers to search for the Allied ships alone, and they happened upon and sank the Soviet cargo ship SS Ijora (2,815 gross tons) that had strayed from QP 8 that afternoon. Tirpitz joined them shortly after, and Silex ordered the destroyers to return to Trondheim on the 8th.
On March 28, Z26 and her sisters Z24 and Z25 departed Varangerfjord to intercept Convoy PQ 13. Late that night, they rescued the 61 survivors of the sunken freighter SS Empire Ranger and then sank the straggling 4,687 GRT freighter SS Bateau. Rescued 7 survivors before resuming the search for the convoy. The light cruiser HMS Trinidad, escorted by the destroyer HMS Fury, spotted the German ship on radar at 08:49 on the 29th and was herself spotted at the same time. Both sides opened fire at close range at 3,200 yards (2,900 m) in a blizzard. Trinidad engaged the German destroyer Z26 and inflicted heavy damage. The destroyer fired 19 torpedoes at the cruiser, but they all missed after Trinidad turned away and hit her twice with her 15cm guns, causing only minor damage. The British ship maneuvered to avoid the torpedoes and was forced to break away, and Z26 accidentally became separated from her sisters.
After the Fury turned away to support the cruisers, the destroyer HMS Eclipse began pursuit and by 10:20 had sunk Z26. Eclipse maneuvered to finish off the German destroyer with a torpedo, but when the blizzard ended and visibility cleared, she saw Z24 and Z25 approaching; at 10:35, before she had time to duck under a squall, Z24 and Z25 opened fire on Eclipse, hitting her twice and wounding nine men. The German ships did not put Eclipse in perth and attempted to separate the 88 survivors from Z26.
Reinforced by Z7 Hermann Schoemann and assigned to the Zerstörergruppe Arktis (Arctic Destroyer Group) commanded by Kapitän zur See Alfred Schulze-Hinrichs, the two destroyers searched on April 11 for convoys PQ 14 and QP 10, but were unsuccessful; on April 30, the German submarine U-456 torpedoed and sank the light cruiser Edinburgh, which was part of the convoy QP 11's close escort, rendering it unseaworthy. Later that day, three destroyers were ordered to intercept the ship. The next afternoon they encountered the main convoy of transports and attacked them with limited visibility. Over the next four hours they made five attempts to close with the convoy, but the four escorting British destroyers were able to stay between the Germans and the convoy. Rejected, the Schulze-Hinrichs decided to abort the attack and look for their original objective. The German ships sank the 2,847 GRT freighter SS Ziolkowski with Z24 and Z25 torpedoes and only inflicted heavy damage on the escort destroyer Amazon with their gunfire. The British ship did not hit the German destroyer.
The initial escort of Edinburgh's two destroyers that day was augmented by four British minesweepers and a small Russian tugboat. With the tugboats steering, the cruisers were under their own power by the morning of May 2 at a speed of about 3 knots (5.6 km/h, 3.5 mph). The Germans spotted her and Z7 Hermann Schoemann exchanged fire with the minesweeper Harrier at about 06:27 a.m. Edinburgh then stopped towing and increased her speed to a maximum of about 8 knots (15 km/h, 9.2 mph), turning and steering. Z7 Hermann Schoemann was able to get into a good position to torpedo the Z25 engaged the destroyer Forrester first, hitting her three times around 06:50, disabling two of her guns and hitting the forward boiler room, disabling her power. power was stopped. A few minutes later, the sister ship Foresight passed in front of Forester, attracting the attention of Z24 and Z25, which succeeded admirably, hitting her four times by 07:24, disabling her engines and leaving her with only one gun. Meanwhile, the cruiser was hit by another torpedo at 07:02, but it only destroyed the engine and gave a list to port; Z24 and Z25 were drifting, despite occasional British shells, rather than sinking the three disabled British ships and the lightly armed minesweeper, Z7 Hermann Scherman Z24 and Z25 concentrated on rescuing the crew of Z7 Hermann Schoemann, which was adrift despite occasional British shells. z7 Hermann Schoemann was then roared down using her own bombs. z24 was unharmed during the battle, but z Z25, destroyer Z5 Paul Jacobi, and two torpedo boats escorted the badly damaged Prinz Eugen from Trondheim to Kiel from 16 to 18 May. Shortly after their arrival, the destroyers began a lengthy refit that lasted until November.
On 11 November, she escorted the light cruiser Nuremberg from Svinemünde to Trondheim; in February 1943, she headed to Germany for France, but engine trouble forced the cancellation of the plan on 5 March. Z25 returned to Norwegian waters on April 22, but continued to experience engine problems and was largely inactive until August, when she returned to Germany for an overhaul. During sea trials in Danzig Bay, a shock wave from a nearby mine explosion rendered the port turbine unusable, requiring further repairs.
Activities in the Baltic Sea
6. assigned to the Zellsteller flotilla, Z25 and the flotilla's three other destroyers were transferred to the Gulf of Finland to support mine sweeping operations in the Gulf of Finland, where Z25 arrived at Reval, Estonia, on February 13, 1944. The convoy was initially tasked with escorting convoys between Libau and Reval, Latvia, and on March 12 laid the first minefield in Narva Bay while bombarding Soviet positions on the eastern shore of Narva Bay; until July, the convoy was primarily assigned to mine sweeping duties; on March 13, the convoy arrived in the Gulf of Finland to assist with the minesweeping operation. On 28 June she escorted the heavy cruiser Lützow to the island of Utö in preparation for Operation Tanne West, the operation to occupy Åland in the event of Finland's surrender, but the operation was cancelled and she returned to port.
On 30 July and 1 August, Z25 and three other destroyers sailed to the Gulf of Riga to bombard Soviet positions inland; on 5 August, she escorted Prinz Eugen to attack the Estonian island of Oisel and Latvian targets on 19-20 August; on 15-20 September, Helped evacuate 23,172 people from Reval during the Soviet advance; on August 21, with destroyer Z28, transported 370 people from Baltishport, Estonia, to Libau. The next day, she escorted a ship carrying evacuees from the Åland Sea to Gotenhafen, Germany; on October 10, Z25 sent 200 reinforcements to Memel, and the next day evacuated 200 female naval aides. Upon their return, they shelled targets near Memel. Later, she was slightly damaged in what appeared to be a near miss torpedo attack, and the vibration of the ship's guns caused an oil leak in one of her fuel tanks.
On 4 November, Z25 was incorporated into 8.Zerstörerflotille and supported Lützow and Prinz Eugen as they engaged Soviet positions at Swolbe on Saaremaa Island, Estonia, from 19 to 24 November. refitted in December and on 29 to 30 January 1945 bombarded Soviet forces east and south of Königsberg with Prinz Eugen and two torpedo boats, and again from February 2 to 5 to allow detached German units to enter friendly territory. The ship then escorted a number of refugee ships carrying displaced persons between Gotenhafen and Zasnitz, and on the 20th shelled Soviet positions near the Old Town; a month later, on March 26, the Z25 and Z5 Paul Jacobi carried 22,000 refugees to Copenhagen, Denmark, on the ocean liner " They escorted the Potsdam, the troop carrier SS Goya, and the target ship Kanonie. The ship continued to escort refugee vessels between Hellas and friendly territories throughout April and May, helping to carry 45,000 refugees to Copenhagen on the 5th and returning on the 9th to carry another 20,000 to Glücksburg, Germany. The next day, Z25 was decommissioned.
French route
After the war ended, Z25 called at Wilhelmshaven, where she was overhauled to keep her in navigable condition; she was assigned to England in late 1945 and arrived at Rosyth, Scotland, on January 6, 1946. Following protests from France over its exclusion, the British transferred four of their allocated destroyers, and Z25 arrived in Cherbourg on 2 February. Two days later, she was christened "Ochs," after General Lazare Ochs, and commissioned into the French Navy. Assigned to the large destroyer division 1 (Contre Torpilleur), she trained with the light carrier Arromanches and was commissioned in September. From March to June 1947, she was part of the escort of the battleship Richelieu during French President Vincent Oriol's visit to West and North Africa; in December 1948, she visited Portsmouth, England; on 1 January 1949, she became a reserve ship; from 1950 to 1953 Converted to an escort destroyer (fast escort destroyer) with new weapons and electronics, based at Toulon for anti-submarine testing; needed major refit by 1956, but it was not economical, so she was placed in reserve on 20 August and decommissioned on 1 September; 2 January 1958, Hosch was condemned and renamed Q102; listed for sale on 30 June and scrapped in 1961.
