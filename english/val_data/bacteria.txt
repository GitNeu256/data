Bacteria (singular: bacteria) are a major group of organisms. The term "bacteria" (singular: bacterium) may be applied to all prokaryotes or to a major group called eubacteria, depending on one's view of their relationship. Here, the term "bacteria" is used specifically to refer to eubacteria. The other major group of bacteria (in the broad sense, not in the taxonomic sense) is the archaea. The study of bacteria is known as bacteriology, a branch of microbiology.
Bacteria are the most abundant of all organisms. They are ubiquitous in soil, water, and symbionts with other organisms. Most pathogens are bacteria. Although giant bacteria such as Thiomargarita namibiensis and Epulopiscium fishelsoni can exceed 0.5 mm, most bacteria are microscopic, usually with a longest diameter of 5 to 5.0 μm only. They generally have cell walls like plant and fungal cells, but bacterial cell walls are usually made of peptidoglycan instead of cellulose (as in plants) or chitin (as in fungi and arthropods) and are not homologous to eukaryotic cell walls. It differs in structure from eukaryotic flagella.
History
Bacteria were first observed in 1674 by the Dutch scientist Anton van Leeuwenhoek using a monocular microscope of his own design. He called the bacteria "animalcules" and published his observations in a long series of letters to the Royal Society. The name bacterium was introduced by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1828, from the Greek βακτήριον -α , bacterion -a, meaning "little staff."
Louis Pasteur demonstrated in 1859 that the fermentation process is caused by microbial growth and that this growth is not due to spontaneous generation. (Yeasts and molds commonly associated with fermentation are not bacteria, but rather fungi.) Pasteur, along with his contemporary Robert Koch, was an early proponent of the germ theory of disease. Robert Koch was a pioneer in medical microbiology, working on cholera, anthrax, and tuberculosis. His work on tuberculosis finally proved Koch's germ theory, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1905. Koch's postulates provide the criteria for testing whether an organism is the cause of disease.
In the 19th century, bacteria were known to be the cause of many diseases, but there were no effective antimicrobial treatments; in 1910, Paul Ehrlich developed the first by turning a dye that selectively stains Treponema pallidum, the spirochete that causes syphilis, into a compound that selectively kills the pathogen Ehrlich developed the first antibiotic. Ehrlich was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1908 for his work in immunology and was a pioneer in staining methods to detect and identify bacteria.
In 1977, it was recognized by Carl Wuss that archaea had a separate evolutionary lineage from bacteria. This new phylogeny, based on sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA, divided prokaryotes into two evolutionary domains as part of a three-domain system.
Cell Structure
For more information, see Bacterial Cell Structure.
Bacteria, prokaryotes (organisms without a cell nucleus), have a relatively simple cell structure with no cell nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, or other cell organelles. Most bacteria are relatively small and have characteristic cell and colony morphology (shape) as described below.
The most important bacterial structural feature is the cell wall. Bacteria can be divided into two groups (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) based on differences in cell wall structure as revealed by Gram staining. Gram-positive bacteria have a thick peptidoglycan (called murein in older sources) layer and a cell wall containing teichoic acid. Gram-negative bacteria, on the other hand, have an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and a thin peptidoglycan layer located in the periplasm (the region between the outer membrane and the cytoplasmic membrane).
Many bacteria contain other extracellular structures such as flagella and fimbriae used for locomotion (movement), attachment, and binding, respectively. Some bacteria also have capsules or slime layers that facilitate surface attachment and biofilm formation. Bacteria have relatively few intracellular structures compared to eukaryotes, but they do have tightly wound chromosomes, ribosomes, and several species-specific structures such as intracellular membranes, nutrient storage structures, gas vesicles, and magnetosomes.
Some bacteria are able to form endospores, which allow them to withstand extreme environmental and chemical stresses. This property is limited to certain Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus and Clostridium.
Metabolism
In contrast to higher organisms, bacteria exhibit extremely diverse metabolic types. Indeed, it is widely accepted that eukaryotic metabolism is derived from ancient endosymbiosis, with mitochondria and chloroplasts derived from a lineage of α-proteobacteria and cyanobacteria, respectively.
Bacterial metabolism can be broadly classified according to the type of energy used for growth, the electron donor and electron acceptor, and the carbon source used. Most bacteria are heterotrophic and utilize organic carbon compounds as both carbon and energy sources. In aerobic organisms, oxygen is used as the terminal electron acceptor. In anaerobic organisms, other inorganic compounds such as nitrate, sulfate, and carbon dioxide serve as terminal electron acceptors, leading to the environmentally important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetic acid production, respectively. Non-respiratory anaerobes produce energy and reducing power through fermentation and waste metabolic by-products (e.g., ethanol for brewing). Bacteria that are facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they are placed. As an alternative to heterotrophs, many bacteria are autotrophic and fix carbon dioxide in the cell mass.
Bacterial energy metabolism is based on either phototrophy or chemotrophy. Heterotrophs use inorganic electron donors for respiration (chemoheterotrophs) or biosynthesis and carbon dioxide fixation (phototrophs), while organotrophs require organic compounds as electron donors (and in most cases also as carbon sources) for their biosynthetic reactions. Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia (leading to nitrification), ferrous iron, other reducing metal ions, or elemental iron and some reducing sulfur compounds. Furthermore, methane metabolism, although formally classified as organotrophic, is actually closer to the limnotrophic metabolic pathway. In both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy, oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor, whereas under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds (see above) are used instead. Most photolithotrophs and chemolithotrophs are autotrophs and obtain intracellular carbon by fixing carbon dioxide, while photolithotrophs and chemolithotrophs are heterotrophs.
In addition to carbon, some organisms fix nitrogen gas (nitrogen fixation). This environmentally important trait is found in almost all of the above metabolic types of bacteria, but it is not universal.
The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of organisms has traditionally been used to define their classification, but these traits are often not consistent with genetic methods (see Groups and Identification below).
Growth and Reproduction
All bacteria reproduce by asexual (uniparental) binary fission, in which cell division occurs. Two identical clonal daughter cells are produced. Some bacteria, while reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures to facilitate dispersal of the newly formed daughter cells. Examples include the formation of fruiting bodies by Myxococcus bacteria, the formation of sporophytic mycelia by Streptomyces bacteria, or budding. Budding is the growth and eventual division of a cell "sprout" from another cell.
In the laboratory, bacteria are usually grown in two ways: solid and liquid. Solid growth media, such as agar plates, are used to isolate pure cultures of bacterial strains. Liquid growth media are typically used when quantification of growth or large numbers of cells are required. While growth in agitated liquid media almost always results in a homogeneous cell suspension, and cultures are easier to divide and transfer than in solid media, it is extremely difficult to isolate individual cells from the liquid medium. In both liquid and solid media, there are finite nutrients available for studying the bacterial cell cycle. This limitation can be circumvented by the use of a chemostat. Chemostats maintain a steady state bacterial culture by continuously adding nutrients and removing waste products and cells. Large thermostats are often used for industrial-scale microbial processes.
Most of the techniques commonly used to grow bacteria are designed to optimize the amount of cells produced, the time required for production, and the cost of production. Due to the limited availability of nutrients in the bacteria's natural environment, bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely. This constant limitation of nutrients has led to the evolution of different growth strategies in different types of organisms (see R/K selection theory). Certain organisms have the ability to grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available. An example is the algal (and cyanobacterial) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer. Some organisms have also devised more specialized strategies to be more successful in harsh environments, such as the production of antibiotics by Streptomyces. In the natural environment, many organisms live in communities (e.g., biofilms), which may increase nutrient availability and protect them from environmental stresses. In some bacterial communities, individuals send chemical messages to other members, prompting them to self-destruct. This is presumably because some members of the population under stress sacrifice themselves to provide nutrients necessary for the survival of the population, to prevent the spread of bacterial viruses that infect the population, or to maintain the genetic integrity of the population. In many cases, these relationships are essential for the growth of a particular organism or population (syntrophy). Such evolutionary tactics to overcome nutrient limitation must be illustrated in industrial/laboratory bacterial growth experiments. For example, bacteria with a tendency to aggregate may require more vigorous agitation to break apart large clumps of bacteria. The main growth characteristic that must be understood for controlled growth is that bacteria have distinct growth stages.
Controlled bacterial growth follows three distinct stages. Almost all cultures start from relatively old stock and are diluted into fresh medium. The first stage of growth is the lag phase, a period of slow growth often thought to be due to the cells' need to adapt to fast growth. During the lag phase, biosynthetic rates are high and enzymes necessary to metabolize various substrates are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, also called the exponential phase. The log phase shows rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells proliferate during this phase is known as the growth rate (k). The time it takes for cells to double during the log phase is known as generation time (g). During the logarithmic phase, nutrients are metabolized at their maximum rate until they are exhausted. The final stage of growth is the stationary phase. This growth phase is triggered by the depletion of nutrients. Cells begin to cease metabolic activity and begin to break down non-essential proteins. The stationary phase is the transition from rapid growth to dormancy. Without positive signals from the environment, transcription of many non-essential genes is no longer promoted to conserve ATP.
Genetic Variation
As asexual organisms, bacteria inherit identical copies of their parents' genes (i.e., they are clonal). However, all bacteria have the ability to evolve and alter their genetic material through mutation or genetic recombination. Mutations are the result of errors made during gene duplication and often occur gradually. Mutations can occur spontaneously or due to the presence of mutagenic agents. Mutation rates vary among bacterial species, but usually range from 10^-5 to 10^-7 per gene per generation. Some bacteria increase their mutation rate during DNA replication as a response to stress.
Asexual reproduction does not provide many opportunities for organisms to evolve their genomes. Certain bacteria can also exchange genetic information through bacterial conjugation. The genetic material transmitted can be chromosomal or plasmid-derived. In conjugation, one bacterium, called the F+ type, transmits genetic material to another bacterium (the F- type) via a mating bridge; the F factor is a plasmid, which contains genes encoding autonomous replication, pill formation, and binding transfer functions. When a plasmid is incorporated into a chromosome, it is called a "high frequency recombinant" strain (Hfr). Binding increases the genetic variability of the bacterial population and promotes the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Although this is often considered a primitive form of sexual reproduction, it is not considered sexual reproduction because gametes (n) do not combine to form zygotes (2n) Since the ability to transfer DNA is not universal in the bacterial community, most bacteria also rely on other transfer methods to diversify their DNA rely on other transfer methods to diversify their DNA. The most frequent genetic changes in bacterial genomes are due to random mutations. Bacteria can also undergo genetic recombination. Many bacteria can incorporate foreign environmental DNA from a closely related genus in a process called transformation. In the transformation process, a virus can change the DNA of a bacterium by becoming lytic and introducing foreign DNA into the host chromosome. Horizontal gene transfer is the general term for the acquisition of genes from the environment.
Bacteria have historically been mainstays in the fields of molecular biology, genetics, and biochemistry because they multiply quickly and can be manipulated with relative ease. By inducing mutations in bacteria and studying the resulting phenotypes, scientists have been able to reveal the function of various genes and enzymes. The lessons learned from bacteria can be applied to more complex organisms that are often more difficult to study.
Motility
Motile bacteria can use flagella, gliding, and changes in buoyancy to move. A unique group of bacteria called spirochetes have a flagellum-like structure called an axoneme between two membranes in the periplasmic space. The flagellum has a characteristic spiral shape and wiggles as it moves.
Bacterial flagella are arranged in a variety of ways. Some have a single polar flagellum at one end of the cell, others have clusters of many flagella at one end, and others, such as Peritrichus, have flagella scattered throughout the cell. Many bacteria (e.g., E. coli) have two distinct modes of locomotion: forward locomotion (swimming) and tumbling. Tumbling allows for a change of direction and brings an important element of randomness to forward motion. (See external link below for link to video).
Motile bacteria are attracted or repelled by specific stimuli, such as chemotaxis, phototaxis, motility, and magnetotaxis. In a special group of myxobacteria, individual bacteria may be attracted to form swarms, differentiate, and form fruiting bodies. Myxobacteria are the most common type of E. Motile E. coli in liquid or solid medium.
Groups and Identification
Historically, bacteria originally studied by botanists were classified in the same way as plants, i.e., primarily by shape. Bacteria have a variety of cell forms (shapes), such as bacillus (rod-shaped), coccus (spherical), spirillum (helical), and vibrio (curved rod). However, because of their small size, bacteria are relatively uniform in shape, and thus classification based on morphology has not worked well. The first formal classification system was developed after the development of the Gram stain by Hans Christian Gram. This taxonomy included:
* Bacteria that are Gram-negative and have a second cell membrane.
* Firmicutes - Gram-positive staining bacteria with thick peptidoglycan walls.
* Chondrichthyes - Gram-negative bacteria with no cell wall or secondary membrane.
* Mendocycutes - atypical staining strain now known to belong to archaea
A further development based on this scheme (basically) is the comparison of bacteria based on differences in cellular metabolism as determined by a wide variety of specific tests. Bacteria were also classified on the basis of differences in intracellular chemicals, for example fatty acids, pigments, and quinones. Although it was possible to distinguish bacterial strains by these schemes, it was unclear whether these differences were variations between different species or between strains of the same species. It was not until the use of genome-based techniques such as %guanine + cytosine ratio determination, genome-genome hybridization, and gene sequencing (especially rRNA genes) that microbial taxonomy developed (or at least is developing) into a stable and accurate classification system. It should be noted, however, that bacterial taxonomy remains a changing and expanding field due to the existence of numerous historical classification systems and a lack of understanding of microbial diversity.
Beneficial and Dangerous
Bacteria can be both harmful and helpful to the environment and animals, including humans. The role of bacteria in disease and infection is important. Some bacteria act as pathogens, causing tetanus, typhoid, pneumonia, syphilis, cholera, food poisoning, leprosy, and tuberculosis. Sepsis is a systemic infectious syndrome characterized by shock and massive vasodilation; it is also a local infection caused by bacteria such as streptococci, staphylococci, and many gram-negative bacteria. Some bacterial infections spread throughout the host's body, resulting in systemic infection. In plants, bacteria cause leaf spot, burns, and wilt. Pathways of infection include contact, air, food, water, and insect-borne microorganisms. Pathogen-infected hosts are treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics are classified as bactericidal or bacteriostatic, and at concentrations that reach the body fluids, they either kill bacteria or prevent their growth. To prevent bacterial infection, antiseptic measures are taken, for example, wiping the skin with alcohol before puncturing the skin with a syringe needle. Sterilization of surgical and dental instruments is done to make them sterile or pathogen-free to prevent contamination or infection by bacteria. Sterilizers and disinfectants are used to kill bacteria and other pathogens and prevent the risk of contamination or infection.
In soil, microorganisms living in the rhizosphere (the zone that includes the root surface and the soil attached to the roots after a light shake) help convert molecular dinitrogen gas, a source of nitrogen, into nitrogen compounds in a process known as nitrogen fixation. This serves to provide easily absorbable nitrogen to many plants that cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria live symbiotically in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of intestinal flora in the large intestine prevents the growth of potentially harmful microorganisms.
The ability of bacteria to break down a variety of organic compounds is remarkable. Highly specialized microbiota play an important role in the mineralization of certain classes of organic compounds. For example, the degradation of cellulose, one of the most abundant components of plant tissue, is mainly carried out by aerobic bacteria belonging to the genus Cytophaga. This ability has also been used by humans in industry, waste treatment, and bioremediation. Bacteria capable of digesting hydrocarbons in oil are often used to clean up oil spills; after the infamous Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, fertilizer was applied to several beaches in Prince William Sound to stimulate the growth of such bacteria. These efforts were effective on beaches that were not covered too thickly with oil.
Bacteria, often combined with yeast or mold, are used in the preparation of fermented foods such as cheese, pickles, soy sauce, sauerkraut, vinegar, wine, and yogurt. Biotechnology techniques can be used to bioengineer bacteria for the production of therapeutic drugs such as insulin or for the bioremediation of toxic waste.
The term "beneficial bacteria" refers to bacteria that provide some benefit to the human host, such as lactic acid bacteria, which convert milk proteins into lactic acid in the gut. The presence of colonies of such bacteria also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually by competitive exclusion). Other bacteria that are useful in the body include many strains of Escherichia coli that are harmless to healthy individuals and provide vitamin K.
