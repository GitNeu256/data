Spain is a fan interpretation of the Hetalia webcomic/anime character of "Another Color". His appearance and personality are not very consistently developed, as he was created from the fact that there is a 2P! Italy and a 2P! Romano. This Spain has several scars, and is seen to have brown, purple, maybe green eyes. He wears a brown military uniform. This Spain has long hair, often tied with a purple ribbon, some other fandoms he has his hair normal and short, but black with white stained on his bangs . He is sometimes combined with the "Scarred" appearance. Tsundere. This interpretation of 2P! Spain is usually quiet and short tempered. He seems impatient, and tends to be grumpy even when acting sweet. He is known to be aggressive. Stoic. This interpretation is generally quiet with either a lack of emotion or a lack of an emotional expression. He is of few words, and doesn't particularly like to talk to people. Loner. This interpretation does not like people, or any other of his former colonies/charges. He is patient, very protective of his former charges, and generally lacks the cheerful energy of his counterpart. Sadistic. This interpretation is similar to Stoic; only with the attraction to smaller or weaker nations. It is common for 2P!s to be portrayed as murderous, sociopathic and possibly insane. To most, they are a darker version of the original Nations. However, because the Original Nations can be portrayed the same way by the fandom, how much hold this has depends on the person making the story.
