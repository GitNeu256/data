If you are interested and have ideas to improve the running of this site in whatever way, please contact me via the contact form on the webpage. 08/13/2016 Because this site of music videos was originally set up mainly as a subordinate part of my whole website project to spice up and lessen the heaviness of serious learning, I decided to stop embedding videos regularly since it has accumulated a considerable amount of videos and the editing jobs of other websites have become unbearably heavy. Considering the need that some people may not be that interested in subscribing to a lot of video channels or spending lots of time searching for refreshing materials, I decided to embed some playlist videos here. Since some playlists are under constant renewals, hopefully this site won't become too dull for regular visitors. (Of course you can always consider subscribing to some video channels yourself or supporting some artists and video makers in whatever way you like to.) Sorry again for not being able to dedicate more time to this site. If you have any suggestions, you can always drop me a line via the contact form on the webpage. Take care! 01/30/2016 It seems the pagination html hasn't been working properly on this site since the total posts exceeded a certain number. If you know how to solve this problem, please kindly let me know. 01/13/2016 Unable to figure out a way to balance various demands in life, I decided to stop embedding videos here for a while. May resume the posting work once a solution appears. Can't guarantee it though. 20151220 Due to heavy workloads, from this week on I’ll embed/publish videos only twice per week here: around 00:00 on Wednesday and Saturday (Taipei time). 20151122 From this date on, the regular posting days will be shifted to every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday (three days per week). 20150412 To video editors from "Music & Images": Please don't mind (try not to pay too much attention to, if you can) if I embed all or most of your videos when one is up there on youtube. It's impossible for me to embed every video from all of you as there are so many video sources and the number keeps growing. Furthermore, try to understand that my websites are "personal" sites; therefore, my selections are based on very "subjective" preference only. I do not represent any objective party to judge anyone's videos. My preference may be quite limited and run against your judgment and preference at times. Please don't feel hurt or bad if I do not post some videos you personally like very much. Enjoy your own creative process and trust your own judgment.
