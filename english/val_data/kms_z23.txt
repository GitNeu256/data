Z23 was one of 15 Type 1936A destroyers built for the German Navy during World War II. completed in 1940, she escorted German ships in Norwegian and French waters, occasionally engaging Allied battleships. in early 1941, she was assigned to the Baltic Sea and southern Norway between escorted ships, and for the next four months protected ships passing through the Bay of Biscay. In June, a few months after Operation Barbarossa was launched, Z23 was transferred to northern Norway, where she attempted to intercept one of the Arctic convoys returning from the Soviet Union and helped lay several minefields.
In early 1943, she was transferred to France and resumed her earlier role of escorting ships through the Bay of Biscay. The Bay of Biscay was threatened by Allied aircraft and cruisers attempting to prevent Axis blockade ships from reaching the port. One such mission led to the Battle of the Bay of Biscay at the end of the year, in which Z23 played a small role; on August 12, she was bombed by British heavy bombers and was a total loss in construction. After the war, she was salvaged by the French and used as a source of spare parts for ex-German destroyers in service; she was condemned in 1951 and later dismantled.
Design and Overview
The Type 1936A destroyer was slightly larger and heavier armed than the preceding Type 1936 destroyer. Its overall length was 127 meters (416 feet 8 inches) and its length at the draft line was 121.9 meters (399 feet 11 inches). The beam was 12 meters (39 feet 4 inches) and the maximum draft was 4.62 meters (15 feet 2 inches). Two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, used steam supplied by six Wagner water tube boilers to produce 70,000 PS ( Z23 was designed to generate 51,000 kW (51,000 kW; 69,000 shp) and had a design speed of 36 knots (67 km/h; 41 mph). z23 could carry up to 791 tons (779 t) of fuel oil and travel 2,500 nautical miles (4,600 km; 2, 900 miles) at 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph). 900 miles) range. The crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors.
She was armed with one 15cm TbtsK C/36 cannon forward of the superstructure and three aft. Antiaircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm C/30 guns mounted on two mounts next to the rear funnel and five 2 cm C/30 guns on a single mount; Z23 carried eight 53.3 cm torpedo tubes on two powered mounts. Two reloads were provided on each mount. The aft deck was also equipped with a mine track that could carry up to 60 mines. A "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) passive hydrophone was fitted to detect submarines and probably also S-Gerät sonar. The upper bridge was equipped with a FuMO 21 or FuMO 24/25 radar.
Modifications
Z23's forward 15cm single gun was replaced by a 15cm LC/38 turret during a refit in early 1942. This worsened the Type 36A's tendency to land on her bow and reduced her speed to 32.8 knots (60.7 km/h, 37.7 mph) By 1944, the ship's anti-aircraft equipment was augmented by a pair of four 2cm guns, probably added during the early 1942 refit.
Commissioning History
Z23 was ordered from AG Weser (Deschimag) on 23 April 1938; she was broken ground on 15 November 1938 at the Bremen shipyard in Deschimag as yard number W957, launched on 15 December 1939, and commissioned on 15 September 1940. After commissioning, from March to June 1941, Z23 began escorting, among others, the battleship Bismarck and the heavy cruisers Admiral Hipper and Admiral Scheer between the Baltic Sea and southern Norway; on June 12-13, Z23 was one of the escorts of the heavy cruiser Lützow as she attempted to sail into the Atlantic. The escort was to include the heavy cruiser Lützow. Several Bristol Beaufort planes spotted Lützow and her escort off Norway, and one surprised them in the early morning hours of June 13, hitting the cruiser with a torpedo and forcing Lützow to return to Germany for repairs. On October 23, she was ordered to northern Norway.
Arriving in Tromsø at the end of November, the sisters were assigned to Destroyer Squadron 8 under Captain Hans Erdmenger, and on 17 December Z23, along with her sisters Z24, Z25, and Z27, sailed into the Barents Sea on 16 December 1941, searching for Allied ships off the Kola Peninsula. The next day, Z25's radar spotted two ships at a distance of 37.5 kilometers (23.3 miles) in a thick fog. The Germans thought they were Soviet destroyers, but in fact they were two British minesweepers, Hazard and Speedy, which were sailing to rendezvous with Convoy QP 6. The Germans intercepted them, but were unable to fire accurately due to thick fog and icing. Despite four hit-and-runs to Speedy and a large expenditure of ammunition, the British ship was able to escape; on January 13, 1942, Z25 escorted Z23 and Z24 to lay a minefield in the West Channel of the White Sea. A week later, on January 20, Z23 accidentally collided with Z24 in thick fog, forcing the latter to return to Wesermünde and the former to sail to Trondheim for repairs and a long refit that lasted until August.
After escorting the minesweeper Ulm to Narvik, she participated with Admiral Hipper and her sister ships Z28, Z29, and Z30 in Operation Zarin, a minesweeping operation off the island of Novaya Zemlya from September 24 to 28; from October 23 to 24, she escorted the battleship Tirpitz and Admiral Schell from Bogen Bay On October 23-24, she escorted the battleships Tirpitz and Admiral Scheer from Bogen Bay to Trondheim, sailed with Admiral Scheer to Copenhagen, Denmark, and then returned to Alta Fjord with the light cruiser Nuremberg. Due to engine trouble, she was unable to participate in Operation Regenbogen, the end-of-year attack on Convoy JW 51B.
On March 5, 1943, 8. Zersteller Flotilla (Z23, Z24, Z32, Z37) was transferred to the French Atlantic coast via the English Channel in Operation Karin. Despite attacks by British coastal artillery and motor torpedo boats, the flotilla was able to pass through the Strait of Dover unscathed, but Z37 ran aground at Le Havre en route. The flotilla provided distant cover for the Italian blockade ship Himalaya as she attempted to sail to the Far East on March 28, but had to return to Bordeaux when she was spotted by British scouts. two days later, the flotilla escorted the Italian blockade ship Pietro Orseolo in the Bay of Biscay, but the ship was torpedoed by American submarines and heavily attacked by Bristol Beaufighter fighter-bombers and Beaufort torpedo bombers. The German destroyer shot down five attack planes. Himalaya attempted another breakout on April 9, but was spotted by a Short Sunderland flying boat. After reversing course, it was attacked by Vickers Wellington bombers and Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers. Five of the attacking planes were shot down, but the Z23 suffered five dead and 31 wounded in the fighting. The flotilla escorted submarines in the bay throughout the summer; from December 24 to 26, it was one of the escorts of the 6,951 GRT blockade ship MV Osorno through the Bay of Biscay. During the mission, the ship suffered severe maritime casualties and lost four crew members to maritime accidents before returning to Bordeaux.
Battle of the Bay of Biscay
Another blockade runner, the 2,729 GRT refrigerated freighter MV Alster Ufer, pursued Osorno a few days late, and on December 27, four destroyers, including Z23 of 8. Flotilles, and six torpedo boats from 4. Torpedo Boat Flotilles (4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla) sailed to escort Osorno. The Allies, aware of the existence of these blockade flotillas through Ultra's code-breaking activities, deployed cruisers and aircraft in the western Atlantic to intercept them in Operation Stonewall. Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers of the Royal Air Force's 311th Squadron sunk the Ulster Ufer that afternoon.
The German ships were unaware of the sinking until the following afternoon and continued on to the rendezvous point. They were spotted by American Liberator bombers on the morning of the 28th, and the British light cruisers Glasgow and Enterprise, assigned to Stonewall, maneuvered to intercept them. By this time the weather had deteriorated considerably, and the German ships were sailing homeward, hampered by rough seas that splashed against their forward guns and made them very difficult to work. In addition, the spray made visibility extremely poor, hampering the rangefinders and sights on the guns and torpedoes. Using radar, Glasgow opened fire first at 13:46 at a range of 19,600 meters (21,400 yards) on the nearest German ships Z23 and Z27, with Enterprise following a few minutes later. Z23 closed to range to 17,000m (19,000yd) and fired six torpedoes, all missing. At that time, the destroyers began to counterattack. at 14:18, Erdmenger decided to split the force and ordered Z23, Z27, and three torpedo boats to reverse course to the north. Z23 fired another torpedo, which also missed five minutes later. The cruisers pursued the group to the north and hit Z27's forward boiler room, disabling one of her turbines and gradually reducing her speed. Glasgow and Enterprise again opened concentrated fire on the three torpedo boats to the south at 14:39, sinking two of them; Z23 attempted to go to the aid of the drifting Z27, but was ordered to break off when Enterprise appeared. Torpedo boat T22 joined Z23 and the two ships arrived at St. Jean de Luz near the Spanish border later that day.
On January 30, 1944, Z23, along with Z32 and Z37, was maneuvering in the southern Bay of Biscay when the former collided with Z37. The impact caused a torpedo warhead to explode, destroying both turbines and causing a major fire on board; Z23 towed the ship to Bordeaux, where she was declared a total loss. She then resumed escorting U-boats sailing in the Bay of Bordeaux, but was anchored at La Pallis when she was attacked by 14 Avro Lancaster heavy bombers on August 12. One bomb penetrated the forward boiler room and exploded on the harbor bottom, and another landed nearby. The ship began to flood and was unable to pump until connected to shore power and listed to port; Z23 was also considered a constructive total loss and was decommissioned on August 20 with all non-salvageable equipment destroyed. The French Navy refloated her in 1945 and towed her to Cherbourg two years later for use as a reserve ship; she was decommissioned on October 7, 1951, and subsequently scrapped.
