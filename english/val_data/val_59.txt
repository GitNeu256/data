The Turkish House (also called Turkevi Center) is a 561-foot-high (171 m), 36-floor skyscraper located at 821 United Nations Plaza (First Avenue) in Turtle Bay, Manhattan, New York City, United States, across from the headquarters of the United Nations. Turkish House serves as the headquarters of multiple Turkish diplomatic missions in New York City, as well as a center of Turkish cultural activity.
Description
Turkish House, designed by Perkins Eastman, is 35 stories tall and measures 561 feet (171 m) from the ground to the roof. The building contains about 220,000 square feet (20,000 m2) of usable space, of which 180,000 square feet (17,000 m2) is used by the Permanent Mission of Turkey to the United Nations and the Consulate General of Turkey in New York City; the rest is residential space. The curved facade is an allusion to the crescent on the flag of Turkey, while the top of the skyscraper is shaped like a tulip, the national flower of Turkey.
The first 36 floors contain 102,000 square feet (9,500 m2) of commercial space. The tower has an auditorium and office floors for the UN mission as well as the consulate. Outdoor terraces are located on the 5th, 11th, and 16th floors. The building also has a prayer room, meeting rooms, and exhibition space. Beginning on the 20th floor are apartments, some of which are used by Turkish diplomatic missions. The total residential space is 40,000 square feet (3,700 m2), with each unit averaging about 2,045 feet (623 m). Two duplex apartments are planned. A fitness center, shared terrace space, and a parking garage will be available for residents.
History
The government of Turkey hired Cresa Partners in 2012 to demolish two existing buildings in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City, facing the headquarters of the United Nations, and to construct a new building housing a Turkish consulate on the site. The Turkish government filed plans for the tower with the New York City Department of Buildings in March 2016. After Cresa announced in September 2016 that it would no longer work on the Turkish consulate, the Turkish government sued Cresa that November.
Construction commenced in September 2017. The building was largely completed by May 2021, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan formally opened the center on September 20, 2021.
Multiple windows of the building came under attack by Recep Akbıyık on May 22, 2023, and was condemned by U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.
