Neo-Nazism consists of extremist, social and political movements that have sought to revive and reinstate Nazi ideology since World War II. Neo-Nazis use their ideology to promote hatred and racial supremacy (often white supremacy), to attack racial and ethnic minorities (often anti-Semitism and Islamophobia), and in some cases to create fascist states.
Neo-Nazism is a global phenomenon and has organized representatives in many countries and international networks. It borrows elements from Nazi doctrine, including anti-Semitism, ultranationalism, racism, xenophobia, ableism, homophobia, anti-communism, and the creation of a "Fourth Reich." Holocaust denial is common in neo-Nazi circles.
Neo-Nazis regularly display Nazi symbols and express admiration for Adolf Hitler and other Nazi leaders. In some European and Latin American countries, laws prohibit the expression of pro-Nazi, racist, anti-Semitic, and homophobic views. In many European countries (especially Germany), Nazi-related symbols are banned in order to curb neo-Nazism.
Definition.
The term "neo-Nazism" refers to post-World War II extremist, social, and political movements that seek to revive all or part of the ideology of Nazism.
The term "neo-Nazism" also refers to the ideology of these movements, which borrowed elements from Nazi doctrines such as ultranationalism, anticommunism, racism, ableism, xenophobia, homophobia, and anti-Semitism, sometimes leading to the creation of the Fourth Reich. Holocaust denial is a common feature, as is the incorporation of Nazi symbols and praise for Adolf Hitler.
Neo-Nazism is considered a special form of far-right politics and right-wing extremism.
Hyper-Racism
See also: esoteric nazism.
Neo-Nazi writers advocate a spiritual and esoteric doctrine of race that goes beyond the largely Darwinian-inspired materialist scientific racism that was popular in the 20th century, mainly in the Anglosphere. Influential figures in the development of neo-Nazi racism, such as Miguel Serrano and Julius Evola (a writer identified by Nazism critics such as the Southern Poverty Law Center as influential in some of the "strange peripheries of past and present National Socialism"), have argued that the Aryan hyperborean ancestry was, in the distant past, "a suffered from "involution" due to miscegenation with the "Tellurians" and claimed to have been much higher than their present state; they are thought to be the creations of the Demiurge. According to this theory, in order for the "Aryans" to return to the golden age of the distant past, they would need to awaken the memory of their blood. Hyperborean origins are often claimed to be extraterrestrial. These theories are influenced by Gnosticism and Tantrism and build on the work of the Arnenave. Within this racist theory, Jews are treated as the antithesis of nobility, purity, and beauty.
Ecology and Environmentalism
Neo-Nazism is generally linked to variations of blood-and-soil environmentalism, with themes common to deep ecology, the organic movement, and animal protectionism. Sometimes called "ecofascism," this trend is typified by Richard Walter Dahle, who served as Reich Minister of Food from 1933 to 1942.
History
Germany and Austria, 1945-1950s
After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the political ideology of the dominant party, Nazism, collapsed completely. The last leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) was Martin Bormann. He died on May 2, 1945, during the Battle of Berlin, but the Soviet Union did not announce his death to the world, and his ultimate fate remained a mystery for many years. As for Hitler himself, conspiracy theories emerged that he had secretly survived the war and fled to South America and elsewhere.
The Allied Forces Control Council officially dissolved the NSDAP on October 10, 1945, marking the end of "old" Nazism. The process of de-Nazification began, the Nuremberg trials took place, and by October 1946 many key leaders and thinkers had been put to death, some by suicide.
In both East and West, surviving former party members and veterans assimilated into the new reality and showed no interest in building "neo-Nazism." However, in the 1949 West German elections, Nazi advocates like Fritz Rösler entered the German Judicial Party, the national conservative party, and five party members were elected. Rösler and others left the party and founded the more radical Socialist Reich Party (SRP), led by Otto Ernst Remer. When the Cold War began, the SRP supported the Soviet Union over the United States.
National independence was restored in Austria, and the Verbotsgesetz of 1947 explicitly criminalized the NSDAP and attempts to revive it. West Germany banned the SRP in 1952 because of its opposition to liberal democracy in Article 21, Paragraph 2 of the Basic Law.
As a result, some members of the budding neo-Nazist movement in Germany joined the German Reich Party, of which Hans Ulrich Rudel was the most prominent figure. Younger members founded the Wiecking Jugend, modeled after the Hitler Jugend. The German Reich Party stood in elections from 1953 to 1961, winning about 1% of the vote each time. Rudel befriended the French-born Savitri Devi, a supporter of esoteric Nazism, and during the 1950s she wrote a number of books, including "Pilgrimage" (1958), which dealt with prominent Third Reich sites, and "Lightning and Sun" (1958), which claimed that Adolf Hitler was an avatar of the god Vishnu He wrote many books, including. The Altgemeinschaft, founded by former Nazi SS officer Wilhelm Kusserow, sought to promote a new paganism. In the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), former SA officer Wilhelm Adam founded the German National Democratic Party, which reached out to those who had been attracted to the Nazi Party before 1945 and provided a political outlet so that they would not again support the far right or turn to the anticommunist Western Allies. Joseph Stalin hoped to use them to create a new pro-Soviet, anti-Western trend in German politics. According to top Soviet diplomat Vladimir Semyonov, Stalin even proposed allowing them to continue publishing their own newspaper, the Ferkischer Beobachter. In Austria, former SS member Wilhelm Lang founded an esoteric group known as the Vienna Lodge, which promoted Nazism, occultism such as the Black Sun, and the idea of a Third Reich survival colony under the polar ice cap.
With the onset of the Cold War, the Allies lost interest in prosecuting anyone as part of their de-Nazification; in the mid-1950s, this new political climate allowed Otto Strasser, an NS activist on the NSDAP left and founder of the "Black Front," to return from exile. in 1956, Strasser founded the Black Front's successor organization, the German Socialist League, which promoted a Strasserian "nationalist and socialist" policy, but dissolved in 1962 due to lack of support. Other Third Reich-related organizations were HIAG and Stille Hilfe, which promoted the interests of Waffen-SS veterans and aimed to restore them to the new democratic society. However, they did not advocate restoring Nazism, but instead collaborated with social democrats and Christian democrats.
Many of the bureaucrats who served in the Third Reich continued to work in German public administration after the war. According to the Simon Wiesenthal Center, many of the more than 90,000 Nazi war criminals recorded in German files held key positions under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. It was not until the 1960s that those from concentration camps were prosecuted by West Germany in the Belzec, Frankfurt-Auschwitz, Treblinka, Chelmno, and Sobibor trials. However, the government had passed laws prohibiting Nazis from publicly expressing their beliefs.
"Universal National Socialism," 1950s-1970s.
Neo-Nazism began to find expression outside Germany, including in countries that had fought against the Third Reich during World War II, and sometimes took on pan-European or "universal" characteristics beyond the confines of German nationalism. The two main trends, differing in style and even worldview, were the followers of the American Francis Parker Yockey, who was basically anti-American and advocated pan-European nationalism, and the followers of the American conservative George Lincoln Rockwell.
Yockey was a neo-Spenglerian writer who wrote The Imperium: A Philosophy of History and Politics (1949), dedicated to the "hero of the 20th century" (i.e., Adolf Hitler) and founded the European Liberation Front. To this end, he advocated a national Bolshevik Red-Brown alliance against American culture, influencing such 1960s figures as SS veteran Jean-François Tiriart. Yockey also liked Arab nationalism, especially Gamal Abdel Nasser, and viewed Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution positively, visiting government officials there. Yockey's views impressed Otto Ernst Remer and the radical traditionalist philosopher Julius Evola. He was constantly hounded by the FBI and eventually arrested in 1960 and later committed suicide. Domestically, Yockey's biggest sympathizers were the National Renaissance Party, including James H. Mador, H. Keith Thompson, and Eustace Mullins (a disciple of Ezra Pound), and the Liberty Lobby of the Willis cult.
An American conservative, Rockwell became anti-Semitic after being politically active in the anti-Communist and anti-racial integration movements. In response to being called a "Nazi" by his opponents, he theatrically appropriated the aesthetic elements of the NSDAP and "owned" the intended insult; in 1959, Rockwell formed the American Nazi Party and instructed party members to wear SA-style brown shirts and fly the Third Reich flag. In contrast to Yockey, he was pro-American and cooperated with FBI requests. Even though during the short-lived "Brown Terror" intelligence operation the party was mistakenly believed to be a Nasser-Egyptian agent and targeted by COINTELPRO. Later American white nationalist leaders, such as the teenage David Duke and William Luther Pierce of the National Alliance, became involved in politics through the ANP, but soon distanced themselves from any clear self-identification with neo-Nazism.
In 1961, the World National Socialist Alliance was founded by Rockwell and Colin Jordan of the British National Socialist Movement and adopted the Cotswold Declaration. French socialist Françoise Dior was romantically involved with Jordan and his deputy, John Tyndall, who was also a friend of Savitri Devi. The National Socialist movement wore quasi-SA uniforms and confronted the Jewish 62 group in the streets. In the 1970s, riding a wave of anti-immigrant populism and concerned about Britain's national decline, the National Front, led by Tyndall, became associated with neo-Nazism. television programs exposed in 1974's This Week and 1978's World in Action showed their neo-Nazi In 1967, Rockwell was murdered by a disgruntled former member. Matthias Kehr took control of the ANP and, under the strong influence of Savitri Devi, gradually transformed it into the esoteric group known as the New Order.
In Spain under Franco, SS refugees, notably Otto Skorzeny, Leon Degrelle, and Klaus Barbie's son, became associated with CEDADE (Círculo Español de Amigos de Europa), a Barcelona-based organization that spread the Third Reich apologetic. They mingled with neo-Nazi supporters from Marc Fredricksen in France to Salvador Borrego in Mexico. In the post-Fascist Italian social movement, splinter groups such as Ordine Nuovo and Avanguardia Nazionale were involved in the "lead era" and referenced Nazism. Franco Freda created the "Nazi-Maoist" synthesis.
In Germany itself, the various Third Reich nostalgia movements coalesced into the German National Democratic Party in 1964, and in Austria into the National Democratic Party in 1967, which was more publicly cautious than earlier groups but became a major sympathizer of the NSDAP's past.
Holocaust Denial and Subcultures, 1970s-1990s
Holocaust denial, the assertion that six million Jews were not deliberately and systematically exterminated as an official policy of the Third Reich and Adolf Hitler, became a prominent feature of neo-Nazism in the 1970s. Before that time, Holocaust denial had existed as a sentiment among neo-Nazis, but had yet to be systematized as a theory with a bibliographic authority. Few of the leading theorists of Holocaust denial (who call themselves "revisionists") can be unambiguously classified as neo-Nazis (some, like David Irving's writings, put forward views that are clearly sympathetic to Hitler, and publisher Ernst Zündel is an international deeply associated with neo-Nazism), but the primary interest of Holocaust denial for neo-Nazis was the hope that it would help rehabilitate their political ideology in the eyes of the general public: did 6 million really die? (1974) and Arthur Butz's The Hoax of the 20th Century (1976) are prime examples of Holocaust denial material.
The main international neo-Nazism movement of this period was the radicalization of the Vlaamse Militanten Orde, led by former Hitlerjugend member Bart Eriksson. They began hosting an annual conference called "The Iron Pilgrimage" in Diksmuide, which attracted the same kind of ideologues from inside and outside Europe. Similarly, the NSDAP/AO, led by Gary Lack, was formed in the United States in 1972 to challenge the international influence of the Rockwellian WUNS. Lack's organization gained support from Povl Riss-Knudsen's Danish National Socialist Movement and various German and Austrian figures who felt that the "national democratic" parties were bourgeois and insufficiently Nazi-oriented. These included Michael Kühnen, Christian Wolch, Bella Ewald Altans, and Gottfried Küssel of the ANS/NS, founded in 1977 to seek the establishment of a Germanic Fourth Reich Some members of the ANS/NS were involved in planning paramilitary attacks on NATO bases inside Germany. and were imprisoned for planning a paramilitary attack on a NATO base in Germany and for planning the release of Rudolf Hess from Spandau prison. The organization was officially banned by the Minister of the Interior in 1983.
In the late 1970s, British subculture became associated with neo-Nazism. Some of the skinheads, who portrayed hyper-masculine, crude, and aggressive images and made working-class references, joined the British movement under Michael McLaughlin (Colin Jordan's successor), while others became involved in the National Front's "Rock Against Communism" project, which was intended to counter the SWP's "Rock Against Racism The most important of those who participated in this project were the members of the National Front's "Rock Against Communism" project. The most important musical group involved in this project was Screwdriver, led by Ian Stuart Donaldson. Donaldson, along with former BM member Nicky Crane, founded the international network Blood and Honor in 1987, and by 1992 this network, with the advice of Harold Covington, had become a paramilitary organization that intersected with football hooligan organizations such as the Chelsea Headhunters The network developed Combat 18, a paramilitary organization that intersected with football hooligan organizations such as the Chelsea Headhunters. The neo-Nazi skinhead movement spread to the U.S., where groups such as the Hammerskins were formed, spread by Tom Metzger of the White Aryan Resistance after 1986. Since then it has spread throughout the world. Films such as "Romper Stomper" (1992) and "American History X" (1998) established the public perception that neo-Nazism and skinheads are synonymous.
Former Chilean diplomat Miguel Serrano also took a new turn on the esoteric level by integrating and developing already existing theories based on the writings of Carl Jung, Otto Rahn, Wilhelm Landig, Julius Evola, and Savitri Devi. Serrano was a member of the National Socialist movement in Chile in the 1930s and had been in contact with important figures in Europe and abroad since the early days of neo-Nazism. Despite this, he was able to serve as ambassador in many countries until the rise of Salvador Allende. (Adolf Hitler: The Ultimate Avatar) in 1984. Serrano argued that the Aryans were extragalactic beings who founded Hyperborea and lived a heroic, bodhisattva-like life, while the Jews were created by the Demiurge and cared only for crude materialism. Serrano argued that if the Hyperboreans purified their blood (which is considered the light of the Black Sun) and regained their "blood memory," they could reach a new golden age. Like Savitri Devi before him, Serrano's work became an important reference for neo-Nazism.
Removal of the Iron Curtain, 1990s-Present
With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, neo-Nazism began to spread its ideas to the East amid growing hostility toward the victorious liberal order and the spread of revanchism. In Russia, during the turmoil of the early 1990s, an amorphous mix of KGB hardliners, orthodox neo-Tsarist nostalgists (i.e., Permyats), and outspoken neo-Nazis scattered into the same camps. They were united in their opposition to American influence, to the liberalizing legacy of Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, and in the Jewish question, where Soviet zionology merged with more overt anti-Jewish sentiment. The most important organization representing this was Russian National Unity under the leadership of Aleksandr Barkashov, in which Russians in black uniforms marched under the banner "Russia for Russians" with a red flag incorporating a swastika. These forces rallied in a last ditch effort to defend the Russian Supreme Soviet against Boris Yeltsin during the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993. Not only in Russia, but also in the newly independent former Soviet states, commemorative ceremonies for the SS volunteers became an annual event.
The developments in Russia excited German neo-Nazism. Neo-Nazism dreamed of a Berlin-Moscow alliance against the "decadent" Atlanticist forces. Zundel traveled to Russia and met with former KGB general Aleksandr Stergilov and other members of Russian national unity. Despite these initial aspirations, international neo-Nazism and similar ultra-nationalism would split as part of the breakup of Yugoslavia over the Bosnian conflict of 1992-1995. This split was primarily along ethnic and sectarian lines. The Germans and French supported mainly Western Catholic Croats (Lauk's NSDAP/AO explicitly called for volunteers, Keunen's Free German Workers' Party responded, and the French formed the "Jacques Doriot Collective"), while the Russians and Greeks supported the Orthodox Serbs (see Russians such as Barkashov's Russian National Unity, Eduard Limonov's National Bolshevik Front, and members of the Golden Dawn joined the Greek Volunteers). Indeed, the resurgence of ethnic Bolshevism was able to steal some of the thunder from overt Russian neo-Nazism, as ultranationalism worshiped Joseph Stalin on behalf of Adolf Hitler, but was also devoted to the Nazi aesthetic.
Similar European Movements
Outside of Germany, countries that had their own ultranationalist movements that were involved with the Axis powers and sometimes collaborated with the Third Reich, but were not strictly German-style National Socialists, have seen a postwar revival of various loosely related ideologies, just as neo-Nazism did in Germany Reconstructionist and nostalgic movements emerged that sought to revive the various loosely related ideologies, as neo-Nazism did in Germany. These movements included the Italian neo-fascists and post-fascists, the French Vichyists, Petainists, and "ethnic Europeans," Croatian Ustash sympathizers, Serbian neo-Cetniks, Romanian Iron Guard revivalists, and Hungarist and Holzists in Hungary. The following groups are included in the list.
Issue.
Ex-Nazis in mainstream politics
The most important international case is the election of Kurt Waldheim as President of Austria in 1986. Waldheim was a member of the National Socialist German Students' Union (SA) and was apparently an intelligence officer during World War II. He later served as an Austrian diplomat and then as Secretary General of the United Nations from 1972 to 1981. After Waldheim's past was exposed by an Austrian journalist, Waldheim clashed with the World Jewish Congress on the international stage. Waldheim's record was defended by Bruno Kreisky, a Jew who served as Austrian Chancellor. Viktor Ostrovsky claimed that Mossad had doctored Waldheim's files and implicated him in war crimes.
Modern Right-Wing Populism
Although some critics have tried to find a connection between Nazism and contemporary right-wing populism in Europe, few scholars see the two as interchangeable. In Austria, the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) has served as a shelter for ex-Nazis almost from its inception; in 1980, scandal undermined Austria's two largest parties and the economy stagnated. Jörg Haider took over as leader of the FPÖ, partially justifying Nazism and claiming that its employment policies were effective; in the 1994 elections, the FPÖ won 22% of the vote, 33% in Carinthia and 22% in Vienna.
Historian Walter Laqueur argues that even though Haider welcomed ex-Nazis at meetings and went out of his way to greet Schutzstaffel (SS) veterans, the FPÖ is fascist in the traditional sense because it does not make anticommunism an important issue and does not advocate overthrowing the democratic order or using violence He writes that it is not a political party. In his view, the FPÖ is "not quite fascist," but part of a tradition that includes nationalism, xenophobic populism, and authoritarianism similar to that of 19th century Vienna mayor Karl Luger Haider, who left the Freedom Party in 2005 to form the Alliance for Austria's Future, He died in a car accident in October 2008.
Barbara Rosenkranz, the Liberal Party candidate in the 2010 Austrian presidential election, made controversial statements that were considered pro-Nazi. Rosenkranz is married to Horst Rosenkranz, a leading member of the banned neo-Nazi party and a known publisher of far-right books. Rosenkranz says she feels nothing "disgraceful" about her husband's activities.
