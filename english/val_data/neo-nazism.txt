Neo-Nazism consists of extremist, social and political movements that have sought to revive and reinstate Nazi ideology since World War II. Neo-Nazis use their ideology to promote hatred and racial supremacy (often white supremacy), to attack racial and ethnic minorities (often anti-Semitism and Islamophobia), and in some cases to create fascist states.
Neo-Nazism is a global phenomenon and has organized representatives in many countries and international networks. It borrows elements from Nazi doctrine, including anti-Semitism, ultranationalism, racism, xenophobia, ableism, homophobia, anti-communism, and the creation of a "Fourth Reich." Holocaust denial is common in neo-Nazi circles.
Neo-Nazis regularly display Nazi symbols and express admiration for Adolf Hitler and other Nazi leaders. In some European and Latin American countries, laws prohibit the expression of pro-Nazi, racist, anti-Semitic, and homophobic views. In many European countries (especially Germany), Nazi-related symbols are banned in order to curb neo-Nazism.
Definition.
The term "neo-Nazism" refers to post-World War II extremist, social, and political movements that seek to revive all or part of the ideology of Nazism.
The term "neo-Nazism" also refers to the ideology of these movements, which borrowed elements from Nazi doctrines such as ultranationalism, anticommunism, racism, ableism, xenophobia, homophobia, and anti-Semitism, sometimes leading to the creation of the Fourth Reich. Holocaust denial is a common feature, as is the incorporation of Nazi symbols and praise for Adolf Hitler.
Neo-Nazism is considered a special form of far-right politics and right-wing extremism.
Hyper-Racism
See also: esoteric nazism.
Neo-Nazi writers advocate a spiritual and esoteric doctrine of race that goes beyond the largely Darwinian-inspired materialist scientific racism that was popular in the 20th century, mainly in the Anglosphere. Influential figures in the development of neo-Nazi racism, such as Miguel Serrano and Julius Evola (a writer identified by Nazism critics such as the Southern Poverty Law Center as influential in some of the "strange peripheries of past and present National Socialism"), have argued that the Aryan hyperborean ancestry was, in the distant past, "a suffered from "involution" due to miscegenation with the "Tellurians" and claimed to have been much higher than their present state; they are thought to be the creations of the Demiurge. According to this theory, in order for the "Aryans" to return to the golden age of the distant past, they would need to awaken the memory of their blood. Hyperborean origins are often claimed to be extraterrestrial. These theories are influenced by Gnosticism and Tantrism and build on the work of the Arnenave. Within this racist theory, Jews are treated as the antithesis of nobility, purity, and beauty.
Ecology and Environmentalism
Neo-Nazism is generally linked to variations of blood-and-soil environmentalism, with themes common to deep ecology, the organic movement, and animal protectionism. Sometimes called "ecofascism," this trend is typified by Richard Walter Dahle, who served as Reich Minister of Food from 1933 to 1942.
History
Germany and Austria, 1945-1950s
After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the political ideology of the dominant party, Nazism, collapsed completely. The last leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) was Martin Bormann. He died on May 2, 1945, during the Battle of Berlin, but the Soviet Union did not announce his death to the world, and his ultimate fate remained a mystery for many years. As for Hitler himself, conspiracy theories emerged that he had secretly survived the war and fled to South America and elsewhere.
The Allied Forces Control Council officially dissolved the NSDAP on October 10, 1945, marking the end of "old" Nazism. The process of de-Nazification began, the Nuremberg trials took place, and by October 1946 many key leaders and thinkers had been put to death, some by suicide.
In both East and West, surviving former party members and veterans assimilated into the new reality and showed no interest in building "neo-Nazism." However, in the 1949 West German elections, Nazi advocates like Fritz Rösler entered the German Judicial Party, the national conservative party, and five party members were elected. Rösler and others left the party and founded the more radical Socialist Reich Party (SRP), led by Otto Ernst Remer. When the Cold War began, the SRP supported the Soviet Union over the United States.
National independence was restored in Austria, and the Verbotsgesetz of 1947 explicitly criminalized the NSDAP and attempts to revive it. West Germany banned the SRP in 1952 because of its opposition to liberal democracy in Article 21, Paragraph 2 of the Basic Law.
As a result, some members of the budding neo-Nazist movement in Germany joined the German Reich Party, of which Hans Ulrich Rudel was the most prominent figure. Younger members founded the Wiecking Jugend, modeled after the Hitler Jugend. The German Reich Party stood in elections from 1953 to 1961, winning about 1% of the vote each time. Rudel befriended the French-born Savitri Devi, a supporter of esoteric Nazism, and during the 1950s she wrote a number of books, including "Pilgrimage" (1958), which dealt with prominent Third Reich sites, and "Lightning and Sun" (1958), which claimed that Adolf Hitler was an avatar of the god Vishnu He wrote many books, including. The Altgemeinschaft, founded by former Nazi SS officer Wilhelm Kusserow, sought to promote a new paganism. In the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), former SA officer Wilhelm Adam founded the German National Democratic Party, which reached out to those who had been attracted to the Nazi Party before 1945 and provided a political outlet so that they would not again support the far right or turn to the anticommunist Western Allies. Joseph Stalin hoped to use them to create a new pro-Soviet, anti-Western trend in German politics. According to top Soviet diplomat Vladimir Semyonov, Stalin even proposed allowing them to continue publishing their own newspaper, the Ferkischer Beobachter. In Austria, former SS member Wilhelm Lang founded an esoteric group known as the Vienna Lodge, which promoted Nazism, occultism such as the Black Sun, and the idea of a Third Reich survival colony under the polar ice cap.
With the onset of the Cold War, the Allies lost interest in prosecuting anyone as part of their de-Nazification; in the mid-1950s, this new political climate allowed Otto Strasser, an NS activist on the NSDAP left and founder of the "Black Front," to return from exile. in 1956, Strasser founded the Black Front's successor organization, the German Socialist League, which promoted a Strasserian "nationalist and socialist" policy, but dissolved in 1962 due to lack of support. Other Third Reich-related organizations were HIAG and Stille Hilfe, which promoted the interests of Waffen-SS veterans and aimed to restore them to the new democratic society. However, they did not advocate restoring Nazism, but instead collaborated with social democrats and Christian democrats.
Many of the bureaucrats who served in the Third Reich continued to work in German public administration after the war. According to the Simon Wiesenthal Center, many of the more than 90,000 Nazi war criminals recorded in German files held key positions under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. It was not until the 1960s that those from concentration camps were prosecuted by West Germany in the Belzec, Frankfurt-Auschwitz, Treblinka, Chelmno, and Sobibor trials. However, the government had passed laws prohibiting Nazis from publicly expressing their beliefs.
"Universal National Socialism," 1950s-1970s.
Neo-Nazism began to find expression outside Germany, including in countries that had fought against the Third Reich during World War II, and sometimes took on pan-European or "universal" characteristics beyond the confines of German nationalism. The two main trends, differing in style and even worldview, were the followers of the American Francis Parker Yockey, who was basically anti-American and advocated pan-European nationalism, and the followers of the American conservative George Lincoln Rockwell.
Yockey was a neo-Spenglerian writer who wrote The Imperium: A Philosophy of History and Politics (1949), dedicated to the "hero of the 20th century" (i.e., Adolf Hitler) and founded the European Liberation Front. To this end, he advocated a national Bolshevik Red-Brown alliance against American culture, influencing such 1960s figures as SS veteran Jean-François Tiriart. Yockey also liked Arab nationalism, especially Gamal Abdel Nasser, and viewed Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution positively, visiting government officials there. Yockey's views impressed Otto Ernst Remer and the radical traditionalist philosopher Julius Evola. He was constantly hounded by the FBI and eventually arrested in 1960 and later committed suicide. Domestically, Yockey's biggest sympathizers were the National Renaissance Party, including James H. Mador, H. Keith Thompson, and Eustace Mullins (a disciple of Ezra Pound), and the Liberty Lobby of the Willis cult.
An American conservative, Rockwell became anti-Semitic after being politically active in the anti-Communist and anti-racial integration movements. In response to being called a "Nazi" by his opponents, he theatrically appropriated the aesthetic elements of the NSDAP and "owned" the intended insult; in 1959, Rockwell formed the American Nazi Party and instructed party members to wear SA-style brown shirts and fly the Third Reich flag. In contrast to Yockey, he was pro-American and cooperated with FBI requests. Even though during the short-lived "Brown Terror" intelligence operation the party was mistakenly believed to be a Nasser-Egyptian agent and targeted by COINTELPRO. Later American white nationalist leaders, such as the teenage David Duke and William Luther Pierce of the National Alliance, became involved in politics through the ANP, but soon distanced themselves from any clear self-identification with neo-Nazism.
In 1961, the World National Socialist Alliance was founded by Rockwell and Colin Jordan of the British National Socialist Movement and adopted the Cotswold Declaration. French socialist Françoise Dior was romantically involved with Jordan and his deputy, John Tyndall, who was also a friend of Savitri Devi. The National Socialist movement wore quasi-SA uniforms and confronted the Jewish 62 group in the streets. In the 1970s, riding a wave of anti-immigrant populism and concerned about Britain's national decline, the National Front, led by Tyndall, became associated with neo-Nazism. television programs exposed in 1974's This Week and 1978's World in Action showed their neo-Nazi In 1967, Rockwell was murdered by a disgruntled former member. Matthias Kehr took control of the ANP and, under the strong influence of Savitri Devi, gradually transformed it into the esoteric group known as the New Order.
In Spain under Franco, SS refugees, notably Otto Skorzeny, Leon Degrelle, and Klaus Barbie's son, became associated with CEDADE (Círculo Español de Amigos de Europa), a Barcelona-based organization that spread the Third Reich apologetic. They mingled with neo-Nazi supporters from Marc Fredricksen in France to Salvador Borrego in Mexico. In the post-Fascist Italian social movement, splinter groups such as Ordine Nuovo and Avanguardia Nazionale were involved in the "lead era" and referenced Nazism. Franco Freda created the "Nazi-Maoist" synthesis.
In Germany itself, the various Third Reich nostalgia movements coalesced into the German National Democratic Party in 1964, and in Austria into the National Democratic Party in 1967, which was more publicly cautious than earlier groups but became a major sympathizer of the NSDAP's past.
Holocaust Denial and Subcultures, 1970s-1990s
Holocaust denial, the assertion that six million Jews were not deliberately and systematically exterminated as an official policy of the Third Reich and Adolf Hitler, became a prominent feature of neo-Nazism in the 1970s. Before that time, Holocaust denial had existed as a sentiment among neo-Nazis, but had yet to be systematized as a theory with a bibliographic authority. Few of the leading theorists of Holocaust denial (who call themselves "revisionists") can be unambiguously classified as neo-Nazis (some, like David Irving's writings, put forward views that are clearly sympathetic to Hitler, and publisher Ernst Zündel is an international deeply associated with neo-Nazism), but the primary interest of Holocaust denial for neo-Nazis was the hope that it would help rehabilitate their political ideology in the eyes of the general public: did 6 million really die? (1974) and Arthur Butz's The Hoax of the 20th Century (1976) are prime examples of Holocaust denial material.
The main international neo-Nazism movement of this period was the radicalization of the Vlaamse Militanten Orde, led by former Hitlerjugend member Bart Eriksson. They began hosting an annual conference called "The Iron Pilgrimage" in Diksmuide, which attracted the same kind of ideologues from inside and outside Europe. Similarly, the NSDAP/AO, led by Gary Lack, was formed in the United States in 1972 to challenge the international influence of the Rockwellian WUNS. Lack's organization gained support from Povl Riss-Knudsen's Danish National Socialist Movement and various German and Austrian figures who felt that the "national democratic" parties were bourgeois and insufficiently Nazi-oriented. These included Michael Kühnen, Christian Wolch, Bella Ewald Altans, and Gottfried Küssel of the ANS/NS, founded in 1977 to seek the establishment of a Germanic Fourth Reich Some members of the ANS/NS were involved in planning paramilitary attacks on NATO bases inside Germany. and were imprisoned for planning a paramilitary attack on a NATO base in Germany and for planning the release of Rudolf Hess from Spandau prison. The organization was officially banned by the Minister of the Interior in 1983.
In the late 1970s, British subculture became associated with neo-Nazism. Some of the skinheads, who portrayed hyper-masculine, crude, and aggressive images and made working-class references, joined the British movement under Michael McLaughlin (Colin Jordan's successor), while others became involved in the National Front's "Rock Against Communism" project, which was intended to counter the SWP's "Rock Against Racism The most important of those who participated in this project were the members of the National Front's "Rock Against Communism" project. The most important musical group involved in this project was Screwdriver, led by Ian Stuart Donaldson. Donaldson, along with former BM member Nicky Crane, founded the international network Blood and Honor in 1987, and by 1992 this network, with the advice of Harold Covington, had become a paramilitary organization that intersected with football hooligan organizations such as the Chelsea Headhunters The network developed Combat 18, a paramilitary organization that intersected with football hooligan organizations such as the Chelsea Headhunters. The neo-Nazi skinhead movement spread to the U.S., where groups such as the Hammerskins were formed, spread by Tom Metzger of the White Aryan Resistance after 1986. Since then it has spread throughout the world. Films such as "Romper Stomper" (1992) and "American History X" (1998) established the public perception that neo-Nazism and skinheads are synonymous.
Former Chilean diplomat Miguel Serrano also took a new turn on the esoteric level by integrating and developing already existing theories based on the writings of Carl Jung, Otto Rahn, Wilhelm Landig, Julius Evola, and Savitri Devi. Serrano was a member of the National Socialist movement in Chile in the 1930s and had been in contact with important figures in Europe and abroad since the early days of neo-Nazism. Despite this, he was able to serve as ambassador in many countries until the rise of Salvador Allende. (Adolf Hitler: The Ultimate Avatar) in 1984. Serrano argued that the Aryans were extragalactic beings who founded Hyperborea and lived a heroic, bodhisattva-like life, while the Jews were created by the Demiurge and cared only for crude materialism. Serrano argued that if the Hyperboreans purified their blood (which is considered the light of the Black Sun) and regained their "blood memory," they could reach a new golden age. Like Savitri Devi before him, Serrano's work became an important reference for neo-Nazism.
Removal of the Iron Curtain, 1990s-Present
With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, neo-Nazism began to spread its ideas to the East amid growing hostility toward the victorious liberal order and the spread of revanchism. In Russia, during the turmoil of the early 1990s, an amorphous mix of KGB hardliners, orthodox neo-Tsarist nostalgists (i.e., Permyats), and outspoken neo-Nazis scattered into the same camps. They were united in their opposition to American influence, to the liberalizing legacy of Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, and in the Jewish question, where Soviet zionology merged with more overt anti-Jewish sentiment. The most important organization representing this was Russian National Unity under the leadership of Aleksandr Barkashov, in which Russians in black uniforms marched under the banner "Russia for Russians" with a red flag incorporating a swastika. These forces rallied in a last ditch effort to defend the Russian Supreme Soviet against Boris Yeltsin during the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993. Not only in Russia, but also in the newly independent former Soviet states, commemorative ceremonies for the SS volunteers became an annual event.
The developments in Russia excited German neo-Nazism. Neo-Nazism dreamed of a Berlin-Moscow alliance against the "decadent" Atlanticist forces. Zundel traveled to Russia and met with former KGB general Aleksandr Stergilov and other members of Russian national unity. Despite these initial aspirations, international neo-Nazism and similar ultra-nationalism would split as part of the breakup of Yugoslavia over the Bosnian conflict of 1992-1995. This split was primarily along ethnic and sectarian lines. The Germans and French supported mainly Western Catholic Croats (Lauk's NSDAP/AO explicitly called for volunteers, Keunen's Free German Workers' Party responded, and the French formed the "Jacques Doriot Collective"), while the Russians and Greeks supported the Orthodox Serbs (see Russians such as Barkashov's Russian National Unity, Eduard Limonov's National Bolshevik Front, and members of the Golden Dawn joined the Greek Volunteers). Indeed, the resurgence of ethnic Bolshevism was able to steal some of the thunder from overt Russian neo-Nazism, as ultranationalism worshiped Joseph Stalin on behalf of Adolf Hitler, but was also devoted to the Nazi aesthetic.
Similar European Movements
Outside of Germany, countries that had their own ultranationalist movements that were involved with the Axis powers and sometimes collaborated with the Third Reich, but were not strictly German-style National Socialists, have seen a postwar revival of various loosely related ideologies, just as neo-Nazism did in Germany Reconstructionist and nostalgic movements emerged that sought to revive the various loosely related ideologies, as neo-Nazism did in Germany. These movements included the Italian neo-fascists and post-fascists, the French Vichyists, Petainists, and "ethnic Europeans," Croatian Ustash sympathizers, Serbian neo-Cetniks, Romanian Iron Guard revivalists, and Hungarist and Holzists in Hungary. The following groups are included in the list.
Issue.
Ex-Nazis in mainstream politics
The most important international case is the election of Kurt Waldheim as President of Austria in 1986. Waldheim was a member of the National Socialist German Students' Union (SA) and was apparently an intelligence officer during World War II. He later served as an Austrian diplomat and then as Secretary General of the United Nations from 1972 to 1981. After Waldheim's past was exposed by an Austrian journalist, Waldheim clashed with the World Jewish Congress on the international stage. Waldheim's record was defended by Bruno Kreisky, a Jew who served as Austrian Chancellor. Viktor Ostrovsky claimed that Mossad had doctored Waldheim's files and implicated him in war crimes.
Modern Right-Wing Populism
Although some critics have tried to find a connection between Nazism and contemporary right-wing populism in Europe, few scholars see the two as interchangeable. In Austria, the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) has served as a shelter for ex-Nazis almost from its inception; in 1980, scandal undermined Austria's two largest parties and the economy stagnated. Jörg Haider took over as leader of the FPÖ, partially justifying Nazism and claiming that its employment policies were effective; in the 1994 elections, the FPÖ won 22% of the vote, 33% in Carinthia and 22% in Vienna.
Historian Walter Laqueur argues that even though Haider welcomed ex-Nazis at meetings and went out of his way to greet Schutzstaffel (SS) veterans, the FPÖ is fascist in the traditional sense because it does not make anticommunism an important issue and does not advocate overthrowing the democratic order or using violence He writes that it is not a political party. In his view, the FPÖ is "not quite fascist," but part of a tradition that includes nationalism, xenophobic populism, and authoritarianism similar to that of 19th century Vienna mayor Karl Luger Haider, who left the Freedom Party in 2005 to form the Alliance for Austria's Future, He died in a car accident in October 2008.
Barbara Rosenkranz, the Liberal Party candidate in the 2010 Austrian presidential election, made controversial statements that were considered pro-Nazi. Rosenkranz is married to Horst Rosenkranz, a leading member of the banned neo-Nazi party and a known publisher of far-right books. Rosenkranz says she feels nothing "disgraceful" about her husband's activities.
Around the World
Europe
Belgium.
The Belgian neo-Nazi organization Bloed, Bodem, Eer en Trouw (Blood, Soil, Honor, Loyalty) was founded in 2004 after splitting from the International Network (Blood and Honor). The group came into the public limelight in September 2006 after 17 members (including 11 soldiers) were arrested under the December 2003 anti-terrorism and racism, anti-Semitism, and pro-censorship laws. According to Justice Minister Laurette Onkelinx and Interior Minister Patrick Dewael, the suspects (11 of whom were soldiers) were preparing terrorist attacks to "destabilize" Belgium. According to Manuel Abramovic, a journalist for Resistance, radical right-wing extremists always aimed to "infiltrate the state apparatus," including the military, through the Westland New Post and Front de la Jeunesse during the 1970s and 1980s.
The police operation, which mobilized 150 agents, searched five military barracks (Leopoldsburg, Kleine Brogel, Peer, Brussels (Royal Military Academy), and Zedergem, near the Dutch border) and 18 civilian addresses in Flanders. They found weapons, munitions, explosives, and a homemade bomb large enough to "explode a car." The prime suspect, B.T. Bosnia and Herzegovina organized arms trafficking and established international ties, especially with the Dutch far-right movement De Nationale Alliantie.
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In July 2009, the neo-Nazi white nationalist organization Bosanski Pokret Nacionalnog Ponosa (Bosnian National Pride Movement) was founded in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Its model was the Vaffen SS Hanšar Division, composed of Bosnian volunteers. It declared its main enemies to be "Jews, Roma, Serb Chetniks, Croatian separatists, Josip Broz Tito, communists, homosexuals, and blacks." Its ideology is a mixture of Bosnian nationalism, National Socialism, and white nationalism. Ideologies not welcome in Bosnia include: zionism, Islamism, communism, and capitalism. For us the only ideology is Bosnian Nationalism. This group is led by a man nicknamed Saubertsvig after the commander of the 13th SS Hanscher. The group's strongest area of activity is in the Tuzla region of Bosnia.
Bulgaria.
The neo-Nazi party of note in post-World War II Bulgaria is the Bulgarian National Union (New Democracy).
Since 2003, every February 13, Bulgarian neo-Nazis and like-minded far-right nationalists gather in Sofia to commemorate Hristo Lukov, a late World War II general known for his anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi stance From 2003 to 2019, this annual event was It was hosted by.
Croatia.
Croatian neo-Nazis base their ideology on the writings of Ante Pavelić and the Ustashe, a fascist anti-Yugoslav separatist movement. The Ustashe regime committed genocide against Serbs, Jews, and Roma. After the end of World War II, many Ustashe members fled to the West, where they found sanctuary and continued their political and terrorist activities (which were tolerated due to Cold War hostilities).
In 1999, Zagreb's "Fascism Victims' Square" was renamed "Croatian Aristocrats' Square" and criticism of Croatia's attitude toward the Holocaust became widespread; in 2000, the Zagreb City Council renamed the square "Fascism Victims' Square." Many Croatian streets were renamed after Mile Budak, a prominent Ustashist figure, to the outrage of the Serbian minority; since 2002, this trend has been reversed, with few streets named after Mile Budak or other people associated with the Ustash movement. In Sluni, a plaque inscribed with "Croatian Knight Jure Francetić" was erected to commemorate the notorious Ustashe leader, Francetić of the Black Legion. This nameplate remained there for four years until it was removed by the authorities.
In 2003, the Croatian Criminal Code was amended with provisions prohibiting the public display of Nazi symbols, propaganda of Nazi ideology, historical revisionism, and Holocaust denial, but these amendments were invalidated in 2004 because they were not enacted in accordance with the procedures established by the Constitution. Nevertheless, since 2006, Croatian criminal law has explicitly prohibited hate crimes of all kinds based on race, color, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and nationality.
In Croatia, Srbe na vrbe. (Serbs on a willow tree); in 2004, an Orthodox church was spray-painted with pro-Ustashe graffiti. At protests in Croatia, supporters of Ante Gotovina and other then-suspect war criminals (all acquitted in 2012) held up nationalist symbols and pictures of Pavelić; on May 17, 2007, 60,000 people attended a concert in Zagreb by popular Croatian singer Thompson, who Some of them wore Ustaš uniforms. Some of them gave the Ustash salute and shouted the Ustash slogan "For the fatherland - we are ready (Za dom spremni)." The event prompted the Simon Wiesenthal Center to issue a public protest against the Croatian president. There are documented instances of Ustash memorabilia being displayed at the annual Bleiburg commemoration in Austria.
Czech Republic.
The government of the Czech Republic severely punishes neo-Nazism (Czech: Neonacismus). According to a report by the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic, neo-Nazis committed more than 211 crimes in 2013. There are various neo-Nazi groups in the Czech Republic. One of them is the German-based group Votan Jugend.
Denmark.
The Danish People's Party is a neo-Nazi political party founded in Denmark in 2011. It was dissolved in 2017 after its founder, Daniel Stockholm, announced his retirement from politics.
Estonia.
In 2006, Roman Illin, a Jewish theater director from St. Petersburg, Russia, was attacked by neo-Nazis as he returned from a tunnel after a rehearsal. Illin later accused the Estonian police of indifference. When dark-skinned French students were attacked in Tartu, representatives of the Foreign Student Association claimed that the attack was characteristic of a wave of neo-Nazi violence. Estonian police officials, however, said there had been only a few incidents involving foreign students in the past two years.In November 2006, the Estonian government passed a law banning the display of Nazi symbols. In a 2008 report of the UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur, community representatives and non-governmental organizations dedicated to human rights noted that neo-Nazi groups are active in Estonia, particularly in Tartu, and have committed acts of violence against non-European minorities.
The neo-Nazi terrorist organization Feuerkrieg Division is found and active in Estonia, and some members of the Estonian Conservative People's Party have been linked to the Feuerkrieg Division.
Finland.
In Finland, neo-Nazism is often associated with the fascist and pro-Nazi Patriotic People's Movement (IKL) of the 1930s and 1940s, its youth movement "Blue and Black," and its predecessor, the Lapua movement. Postwar fascist groups such as the Patriotic People's Movement (1993), the Patriotic People's Front, the Patriotic National Movement, and the Blue and Black Movement consciously emulated the style of this movement and looked to its leaders as inspiration. Seinajoki's Finnish Party member and police officer caused a minor scandal by wearing a fascist blue and black uniform.
During the Cold War, the Paris Peace Treaty banned all parties deemed fascist, and former fascist activists had to find a new political home. Despite Finlandization, many remained active in public life: three former Waffen SS members served as ministers. Finnish SS battalion officers Suro Suoltanen (Center Party), Pekka Malinen (People's Party), and Mikko Laksonen (Social Democratic Party), a 16-year-old member of Maschinengevea Ski Batayon "Finland," a group of Finns who rejected the peace treaty and wanted to continue fighting the Germans. He was a soldier. Neo-Nazi activities were limited to small, outlawed groups such as the secret Nazi occult group led by Pekka Siitin, which made headlines for its arson and bombing of the Finnish Communist Party's printing plant. His associates also sent letter bombs to leftists, including the headquarters of the Democratic Youth League of Finland. Another group called the New Patriotic People's Movement bombed the leftist Kanzan Utiset newspaper and the Communist Bulgarian embassy. Seppo Celska of the Nordic Territory Party was convicted of torture and murder of gay Jews.
Skinhead culture gained momentum in the late 1980s and peaked in the late 1990s; in 1991, Finland admitted many Somali immigrants, who over the next few years became the They became the main targets of violence. An asylum seeker center was attacked, and in Joensuu, skinheads broke into an asylum seeker center and began shooting at it with shotguns. In the worst cases, Somalis were attacked by 50 skinheads at the same time.
The most prominent neo-Nazi group is the Nordic Resistance Movement, which has been implicated in multiple murders, attempted murders, and assaults on political opponents. Politicians in the Finnish Party, Finland's second largest political party, frequently support far-right and neo-Nazi movements such as the Finnish Defense League, Odin's Soldiers, the Nordic Resistance Movement, Rajat Kiinni (Close Borders), and Suomi Ensin (Finland First).
The NRM and other far-right nationalist parties hold an annual torchlight march demonstration in Helsinki on Finnish Independence Day in memory of the Finnish SS Battalion, and visit the grave of Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim and the monument to the Finnish SS Battalion at Hietaniemi Cemetery. The event is protested by anti-fascists, and counter-demonstrators are violently assaulted by NRM members assigned to provide security. According to police estimates, the demonstration will attract nearly 3,000 participants, and hundreds of police officers are patrolling Helsinki to prevent violent clashes.
France.
In France, the most enthusiastic collaborators during the German occupation were the National Popular Assembly of Marcel Dare (a former SFIO member) and the French Popular Party of Jacques Doriot (a former French Communist). These two groups, like the Germans, considered themselves a blend of ultranationalism and socialism. In the south, there was a Vichy French garrison led by Marshal Philippe Pétain, the "Hero of Verdun," whose national revolution emphasized authoritarian Catholic conservative politics. After the liberation of France and the creation of the French Fourth Republic, under Charles de Gaulle, collaborators were indicted for treason and nearly 800 were executed.
After World War II, the main concern of the French radical right was the collapse of the French empire, especially the Algerian War. Otherwise, fascist activists such as Maurice Bardèche (Robert Brasillac's brother-in-law), SS veteran Saint-Loux, and René Binet were active in France and, along with similar groups throughout Europe, were involved in the European social movement and later the New European Order. Early neo-fascist groups included the Jun Nation, a radical right-wing group that began using the Celtic Cross (which would spread internationally). Pan-Europeanism, "neither East nor West," was most popular among French fascist activists until the late 1960s.
It was during the 1960s, during the French Fifth Republic, that French neo-fascism took a considerable turn for the better. The most clearly pro-Nazi of them all was Marc Fredriksen's FANE. Neo-fascist groups included Pierre Sidos' Occident, Audre Nouveau (banned after violent clashes with the Trotskyist LCR), and the student-based group Union Defense. Many of these activists, such as François Duprat, were instrumental in the creation of the National Front under Jean-Marie Le Pen, but the National Front included not only these neo-fascist elements, but also Catholic integrationists, monarchists, Algerian war veterans, pujadists, national conservatives, and others, A broader selection from the French hard right was included. From these small groups of neo-fascists, the Parti des forces nouvelles (forces party against Le Pen) was formed.
Within the FN, Duprat formed the Groupes nationalistes révolutionnaires faction, which supported FANE until his assassination in 1978. The subsequent history of the French hard right was one of confrontation between the FN, dominated by national conservatives, and the "national revolutionaries" (fascists and national Bolsheviks) offshoots and opponents. The latter include groups in the tradition of Tilliard and Duprat, such as the Parti Communautaire Nationale Europeen, Troisième Voix, Christian Boucher's Nouvelle Resistance, Unite Radical, and more recently the Bloc Identité Direct splits from the FN include the FANE-revival Parti nationaliste français et européen, founded in 1987, which was dissolved in 2000. Neo-Nazi organizations have been outlawed in the French Fifth Republic, but a significant number still exist.
Germany.
After the failure of the German National Democratic Party in the 1969 elections, small groups began to emerge in Germany that sought to revive Nazi ideology. The National Democratic Party split and the paramilitary Wehrsportgruppe was born. These groups attempted to organize under a national umbrella organization, the Action Front of National Socialists/National Activists. The neo-Nazi movement in East Germany began as a rebellion against the communist regime. With the banning of Nazi symbols, neo-Nazism developed as an anti-authoritarian youth movement. A mail order network developed that sent illegal Nazi-themed music cassettes and merchandise to Germany.
Turks in Germany have been victims of neo-Nazi violence on several occasions: in 1992, two young girls were killed along with their grandmother and nine others were injured in the Melun arson attack; in 1993, five Turks were killed in an arson attack in Solingen. In response to the arson, Turkish youths in Solingen rioted, shouting "Nazis out" and "We want Nazi blood. In other parts of Germany, police had to intervene to protect skinheads from the attack. The Hoyelswerda and Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots, which targeted immigrants and ethnic minorities living in Germany, also occurred in the 1990s.
Between 2000 and 2007, eight Turkish immigrants, one Greek immigrant, and one German police officer were murdered by the neo-Nazi National Socialist underground, which has its roots in the former East German state of Thuringia, which the Guardian noted is "one of the centers of the radical right in Germany. The Guardian noted that the NSU is "one of the centers of Germany's radical right. German intelligence agencies have been criticized for handing out lavish cash to informants within the far-right movement. Tino Brandt has publicly stated on television that he receives about 100,000 euros in funding from the German state. Although Brandt did not give "useful information" to the state, the money supported his recruiting efforts in Thuringia in the early 1990s. (Brandt was eventually sentenced to five and a half years in prison on 66 counts of child prostitution and child sexual abuse.)
After a failed bank robbery in Eisenach, the police located the perpetrators. When police closed in on them, the two committed suicide. They had evaded arrest for 13 years. Beate Zeppe, who lived with them in Zwickau, turned herself in to German authorities a few days later. Zeppe's trial began in May 2013, and she was charged with nine counts of murder. She pleaded "not guilty" to the charges. According to The Guardian, the NSU may have enjoyed protection and support from certain "state elements. Anders Behring Breivik, a fan of Tsepe, reportedly sent her a letter from prison in 2012.
According to the 2012 annual report of the German Interior Ministry's Information Office (Verfassungsschutz), Germany was home to 26,000 right-wing extremists, including 6,000 neo-Nazis at the time. in January 2020, Combat 18 was banned in Germany and raids directed against the organization were conducted nationwide. In March 2020, United German Peoples and Tribes, affiliated with the Reichsbürger, a neo-Nazi movement that denies the German state as a legal entity, was raided by German police. Holocaust denial is a crime according to the German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch §86a) and §130 (public incitement).
Greece.
The far-right political party "Golden Dawn" (Χρυσή Αυγή - Chrysi Avyi) is commonly referred to as neo-Nazi, but the group rejects this label. Several members of Golden Dawn participated in the Bosnian conflict as members of the Greek Volunteer Guard (GVG) and were in Srebrenica during the Srebrenica massacre. The party has its roots in the Papadopoulos regime.
Cooperation between the state and neo-Nazis is often seen in Greece; in 2018, evidence of close ties between the party and Hellenic police was presented at the trial of 69 "Golden Dawn" party members.
Golden Dawn has made statements in support of the Assad regime in Syria, and the strasserist group Black Lilies has claimed to have sent mercenaries to Syria to fight alongside the Syrian regime, specifically referring to its participation in the battle for al-Qusayr In the May 6, 2012 parliamentary elections, Golden Dawn won 6. It received 97% of the vote and entered the Greek Parliament for the first time with 21 representatives, but since the elected parties failed to form a coalition government, re-elections were held in June 2012. Golden Dawn won 6.92% of the vote in the June election and entered the Greek Parliament with 18 representatives.
Since 2008, neo-Nazi violence has targeted immigrants, leftists, and anarchist activists in Greece; in 2009, certain far-right groups announced that Agios Panteleimonas in Athens would be closed to immigrants. Neo-Nazi patrols affiliated with the Golden Dawn party began attacking immigrants in the area. Violence continued to escalate until 2010.After the murder of anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas in 2013, the number of hate crimes in Greece declined for several years until 2017.Most of the crimes in 2017 were committed by other groups such as the Criptea organization and Combat 18 Hellas groups.
Hungary.
The historical party in Hungary that was ideologically allied with and inspired by German National Socialism was Ferenc Zarassi's Arrow Cross Party. They called themselves explicitly National Socialists, and in Hungarian political circles this tendency is known as Hungarianism. After World War II, exiles like Arpád Henny kept the tradition of Hungarianism alive. After the 1989 collapse of the People's Republic of Hungary, a Marxist-Leninist state and member of the Warsaw Pact Organization, many new political parties emerged. Among them was István Gyurkös's Hungarian National Front. This party was a Hungarianist party and self-identified as the inheritor of Arrow Crusade-style National Socialism (it clearly accepted this self-identification). in the 2000s, Gyurkesh's movement moved closer to the positions of National Bolshevism and neo-Eurasianism and linked up with Aleksandr Dugin and collaborated with the Hungarian Workers' Party. Some Hungarianists opposed this and formed the Pax Hungarica movement.
In contemporary Hungary, the ultranationalist party Jobbik is considered by some scholars to be a neo-Nazi party. Although the party denies being neo-Nazi, "there is extensive evidence that the party's leading members made no effort to conceal their racism and anti-Semitism." Hungarian far-right scholar Rudolf Paksa describes Jobbik as "anti-Semitic, racist, homophobic, and xenophobic," but not neo-Nazi because it did not pursue the establishment of a totalitarian regime. Historian Christian Ungvari wrote, "One might be forgiven for calling certain messages of Yobbik openly neo-Nazi propaganda. However, the party's popularity is certainly not due to these statements."
Italy.
In the 1950s, the neo-fascist Italian social movement moved closer to bourgeois conservative politics on the national front, with radical youths forming hard-line These organizations were the first to form the Julius Evo These organizations were influenced by the esotericism of Julius Evola and took their cue from the Waffen SS and Romanian leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, whom they considered beyond Italian fascism. They were involved in attacks by the Paramistas from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, including the Piazza Fontana bombing. Delle Chiae also assisted Junio Valerio Borghese in the failed 1970 coup d'état known as the Golpe Borghese, which attempted to restore a fascist state to Italy.
Ireland.

Notable neo-Nazi movements and parties in the Netherlands include the National European Socialist Movement (NESB), the Netherlands People's Union (NVU), the Central Party/Central Party '86 (CP/CP'86), the National Alliance (NA), and the Nationalist People's Movement (NVB). Notable figures include Waffen SS volunteer and NESB founder Paul van Thienen, wartime collaborator and NESB co-founder Jan Waldhaus, former NVU member Bernhard Postma, "Black Widow" Florentin Lost van Tonningen, former NVU leader Wim Boe, CP/CP'86 member and NVB leader; Jan Thein, CP/CP'86 former member and NA leader; Stephan Weikamp, NVU former member and "Hitler look-alike"; Constant Kusters, CP'86 former member and current NVU leader Constant Kusters, and former NVU member and NA leader Virginia Kapitch. Both the General Intelligence and Security Service and nongovernmental organizations such as the far-left anti-fascism research group Kafka have studied neo-Nazism and other political extremism, testifying to the local presence of international movements such as Blood and Honor, Combat 18, Race Volunteer Army, and The Base in the Netherlands and He expresses concern about the online dissemination of alt-right and far-right accelerationist ideas.
Poland.
The Polish Constitution makes it illegal to propagate Nazism, fascism, communism, or other totalitarian regimes, or to incite violence or racial hatred. This is further reinforced by the Polish Criminal Code, which punishes discrediting organizations or individuals on national, religious, or racial grounds with a three-year sentence.
There are several small far-right and anti-Semitic organizations, among them the NOP and ONR (both of which exist legally), which are classified as nationalist and fascist movements, as they often espouse Polish nationalism and national democracy, which Nazism is generally considered to be contrary to the principles of ultra-nationalism but at the same time considered anti-Nazism. While some of their elements may resemble neo-Nazi characteristics, these groups claim that such actions are unpatriotic and that Nazism is an appropriation or slight modification of some existing symbols and characteristics.
The self-proclaimed neo-Nazi movement in Poland treats Polish culture and traditions with contempt, is anti-Christian, and translates various texts from the German language.
According to several reporters' investigations, the Polish government turns a blind eye to these groups, and they freely spread their ideology. It often dismisses their existence as a conspiracy theory, denies their political provocations, considers them too insignificant to be a threat, or tries to justify or downplay the gravity of their actions.
Russia.
This is because one of Hitler's ambitions at the start of World War II was the Generalplan Ost, which envisioned the extermination, expulsion, and enslavement of most or all Slavs (Russians, Ukrainians, Poles, etc.) in Central and Eastern Europe The Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union was a major step in this process. By the end of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, more than 25 million Soviet citizens had died.
The first reports of neo-Nazi organizations in the Soviet Union appeared in the late 1950s. In some cases, participants were attracted primarily by the aesthetics of Nazism (rituals, parades, uniforms, physical strength worship, architecture). Other groups were interested in Nazi ideology, its programs, and the image of Adolf Hitler. The formation of neo-Nazism in the Soviet Union dates back to the turn of the 1960s and 1970s. During this period, these organizations still preferred to operate underground.
Contemporary Russian neo-Nazism was formed in the late 1970s and is associated with the activities of anti-Semitic supporters, especially Moscow Arabist Valery Yemelyanov (also known as "Veremir") and former dissident and neo-Nazi activist Alexei Dobrovolsky (also known as "Dobroslav"). associated with their activities.
During the Soviet era, Viktor Bezversky (Ostromysl), founder of the Petersburg Veddism (a Slavic neo-pagan sect) movement, was an admirer of Hitler and Heinrich Himmler and spread racist and anti-Semitic theories in a small circle of his students, allegedly resulting from interracial marriages, "the He called for the salvation of humanity from its "inferior offspring. He referred to such "inferior people" as "bastards," or "zeids, Indians, gypsies, and mulattoes," and believed that they prevented society from achieving social justice. The first public neo-Nazi demonstrations in Russia took place in Kurgan in 1981, followed by those in Yuzhno-Uralsk, Nizhny Targil, Sverdlovsk, and Leningrad.
In 1982, on Hitler's birthday, a group of Moscow high school students staged a Nazi demonstration on Pushkinskaya Square.

Critical of other major far-right organizations such as the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), as of 1997 RNE members were known as solatniks (armed comrades), trained in combat near Moscow, and many worked as security guards and armed guards. by a Moscow court in 1999, and the group has since declined.
In 2007, Russian neo-Nazis were claimed to represent "half of the entire world."
On August 15, 2007, Russian authorities arrested a student for allegedly posting a video on the Internet showing two migrant workers being beheaded in front of a red and black swastika flag. Aleksandr Verkhovsky, head of a Moscow-based center that monitors hate crimes in Russia, said, "This looks real. The murders are real. There were similar videos in the Chechen conflict. But this is the first time that the murders appear to have been committed intentionally."
Under serious police pressure, acts by racists and neo-Nazis in Russia began to decline in 2009.
Atomwaffen Division Rusland is a Russian neo-Nazi terrorist group found by Russian authorities to be linked to multiple mass murder plots; AWDR was founded by former members of the defunct National Socialist Society, who were involved in 27 murders; AWDR is associated with the local branch of the "Order of the Nine Horns," which was involved in rape, ritual murder, and drug trafficking. Russian authorities raided the Atomwaffen compound in Ulan-Ude and found illegal weapons and explosives.
Serbia.
One example of neo-Nazism in Serbia is the group Nacionalni stroj; in 2006, 18 of its leading members were charged, and the group has been accused of having been involved in the "war on terror" against the Serbian people. In addition to political parties, there are several radical neo-Nazi organizations in Serbia, such as Blood and Honor Serbia and Combat 18.
Slovakia.
The Slovak political party "Kotlebaists - We the Slovak People's Party," which is represented in the National Council and the European Parliament, is widely characterized as a neo-Nazi. Kotleba has softened its image over time and now disputes being a fascist or neo-Nazi, and has even sued media outlets that have described it as neo-Nazi; as of 2020, the party's spokesman is a former member of the neo-Nazi band Bieli Odpol (White Resistance) Ondrej Durica was; 2020 candidate Andrei Medvecky was convicted of attacking a black man while shouting racist slurs, and another candidate, Anton Grunyo, was fined for making a fascist salute.

They are also active in Norway and Denmark; their Finnish branch was banned in 2019.
Switzerland.
The neo-Nazi and white power skinhead scene in Switzerland experienced significant growth in the 1990s and 2000s. This is reflected in the establishment of the Partei National Orientierter Schweizer in 2000, which improved the organizational structure of the neo-Nazi and white supremacist scene.
Ukraine.
In 1991, the Social Nationalist Party of Ukraine (SNPU) was founded. The party combined characteristics of radical nationalism and neo-Nazism; the SNPU was characterized as a radical right-wing populist party that combined elements of ethnic ultranationalism and anticommunism; in the 1990s, the party solicited skinheads and used neo-Nazi symbols, Condemned as neo-Naziism, Oleh Tyfnybok, elected party leader in 2004, made efforts to moderate the party's image by changing the party's name to the All-Ukrainian Association "Svoboda," changing the party's symbols, and expelling neo-Nazi and neo-fascist groups. In Ukraine's 2016 municipal elections, the neo-Nazi Svoboda Party won 10% of the vote in Kiev and came in second in Lviv. In the mayoral elections in the city of Konotop, a candidate from the Svoboda Party won." In 2015, the mayor of Konotop's Svoboda Party reportedly displayed the numbers "14/88" on his car and refused to fly it because the city's official flag has a Star of David on it, implying that Jews are responsible for the Holodomor.
The topic of Ukrainian nationalism and its alleged connection to neo-Nazism has come to the fore in the controversy over the more radical elements involved in the EuroMaidan protests and subsequent Russo-Ukrainian war since 2014. Some Russian, Latin American, American, and Israeli media have described Ukrainian nationalists in the conflict as neo-Nazis.
The Azov Battalion, founded in 2014, is a far-right militia organization with ties to neo-Nazism, whose members wear neo-Nazi and SS symbols and regalia and express neo-Nazi views.
According to Vyacheslav Likhachev of the Institut Francais Institute of International Relations, members of far-right (including neo-Nazi) groups have arguably played a more important role on the pro-Russian side than on the Ukrainian side, especially in early 2014. Members and former members of the National Bolshevik Party, the Russian National Unity (RNU), the Eurasian Youth Union, and Cossack groups participated in separatist recruitment; a former member of the RNU, Pavel Gubarev, was the founder of the Donbass People's Militia and the first "governor general" of the Donetsk People's Republic The RNU is particularly closely associated with the Russian Orthodox Army, one of the separatist units described as "pro-Tsarist" and "militant" Orthodox nationalists. Lusich" is a member of the Wagner Group, a group of Ukrainian Russian mercenaries with ties to far-right extremists. Subsequently, pro-Russian far-right groups lost importance in the Donbass, and the need for Russian extremist nationalists began to disappear.

Asia
Iran.
Several neo-Nazi groups were active in Iran but are now defunct. Supporters of Nazism continue to exist in Iran and are active primarily on the Internet.
Israel.
Neo-Nazi activity is not common or widespread in Israel. One notable example is Patrol 36 in Petah Tikva. Patrol 36 consisted of eight teenage immigrants from the former Soviet Union who attacked foreign workers and homosexuals and vandalized synagogues with Nazi imagery. These neo-Nazis were reportedly active in cities throughout Israel and were said to be influenced by the rise of neo-Nazis in Europe. The rise of this phenomenon is mostly influenced by similar movements in Russia and Ukraine, as it is widely believed to be due to immigration from these two countries, which are the largest sources of immigration to Israel. The widespread publicity of the arrests has led to calls for the Law of Return to be amended to allow neo-Nazis to be stripped of their Israeli citizenship and deported accordingly.
Japan.
The neo-Nazi National Socialist Japan Workers Party has been active in Japan since 1982 and is currently headed by Hitler-glorifying, Holocaust-denying Kazunari Yamada.

He taught us how to defend our national identity," said the 41-year-old co-founder, who calls himself Big Brother. 'I don't agree with his extremism or the start of World War II. But we support his ideology. We support nationalism over fascism.' Some blame it on inadequate historical education.
Taiwan

Canada.
Neo-Nazism in Canada began with the formation of the Canadian Nazi Party in 1965; in the 1970s and 1980s, organizations such as the Western Guard and the Church of the Creator (later renamed Creativity) promoted white supremacist ideals, and neo-Nazism continued to spread throughout the country; Creativity was founded in the United States in 1973, calls for whites to wage racial jihad (lahowa) against Jews and other perceived enemies.
Don Andrews founded the Canadian National Party in 1977. The unregistered party's stated purpose is to "promote and maintain European heritage and culture in Canada," but it is known for its anti-Semitism and racism. Many prominent neo-Nazi leaders belonged to the party, including Wolfgang Drauge, but many of its members left to join the Heritage Front, which was formed in 1989.
Droege founded Heritage Front in Toronto at a time when leaders of the white supremacist movement were "frustrated with the status quo on the radical right" and wanted to bring together unorganized white supremacist groups into an influential and efficient group with a common purpose. Planning for the organization began in September 1989, and the formation of Heritage Front was officially announced a few months later in November; in the 1990s, George Broudy of Resistance Records and his band Lahowa popularized the creativity movement and the white power music scene.

The Northern Order is registered in Canada as a neo-Nazi terrorist organization; NO members have been arrested for trafficking explosives and firearms, and NO has active members of the Canadian Armed Forces.
Due to controversy and discord, many neo-Nazi organizations in Canada have been disbanded or weakened.
Chile.
After the dissolution of the National Socialist Movement of Chile (MNSCH) in 1938, prominent former members of the MNSCH transferred to the Partido Agrario Laborista (PAL), where they gained high status. Some continued to form parties that followed the model; in 1964, a new Old School Nazi Party was formed by schoolteacher Franz Pfeiffer. Among the group's activities were the organization of a Miss Nazi beauty pageant and the formation of a Chilean chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. The party disbanded in 1970. Pfeiffer attempted to restart the party in 1983, following a wave of protests against the Augusto Pinochet regime.
Nicholas Palacios considered the "Chilean Nation" to be a mix of two belligerent ruling ethnic groups, the Visigoths of Spain and the Mapuche of Chile. Palacios traced the origin of the Spanish elements of the "Chilean race" to the Baltic Sea coast, particularly to Götaland, Sweden, which is considered the home of the Goths. Palacios argued that both blond and bronze Chilean mestizos shared a "moral constitution" and masculine psychology. He opposed immigration from southern Europe, arguing that mestizos of southern European origin lack "cerebral control" and are a social burden.
Costa Rica.
Several neo-Nazi groups exist in Costa Rica, some of which have been active online since about 2003. The groups typically target Jewish Costa Ricans, Afro-Costa Ricans, communists, homosexuals, and especially immigrants from Nicaragua and Colombia In 2012, the media discovered a neo-Nazi police officer within the Costa Rican police, who was fired and then in April 2016, jobless and threats from anti-fascists, he committed suicide.
In 2015, the Simon Wiesenthal Center asked the Costa Rican government to close a store in San José that sold Nazi paraphernalia, Holocaust denial books, and other Nazism-related merchandise.
In 2018, a series of pages on Facebook, a social network of neo-Nazi tendencies, took advantage of anti-immigrant sentiment after three tourist murders allegedly committed by immigrants (although in one of the cases the suspect was Costa Rican), recycling old news stories, posting fake news, and and conducted a massive campaign to incite xenophobic hatred, both openly and unobtrusively. A rally against the country's immigration policy was held on August 19, 2018, and was attended by neo-Nazis and hooligans. Although not all participants were affiliated with these groups and the majority of participants were peaceful, the protest turned violent, 44 people (36 Costa Ricans and the rest Nicaraguans) were arrested, and public authorities intervened. Authorities confiscated sharp-edged weapons and Molotov cocktails from neo-Nazis carrying swastika flags. An anti-extremism march in solidarity with Nicaraguan refugees followed a week later with more support; a second anti-immigration demonstration in September, explicitly excluding neo-Nazis and hooligans, was held with similar support; in 2019, a Facebook page with far-right tendencies and an anti-immigration position Resistance and Rescue Costa Rica, with Page as its deputy 58, called for an anti-government demonstration on May 1, but it was poorly attended.
Peru.
Peru is home to neo-Nazi groups represented by the National Socialist Movement Awaken Peru, the National Socialist Tercios of New Castile, and the National Socialist Coalition of Peru.
United States.
There are several neo-Nazi groups in the U.S. The National Socialist Movement (NSM), with approximately 400 members in 32 states, is currently the largest neo-Nazi organization in the United States. After World War II, new organizations were formed with varying degrees of support for Nazi principles; in 1958, Edward Reed Fields and J. Stoner opposed racial integration in the American South with Nazi-inspired publications and iconography. The American Nazi Party, formed in 1959 by George Lincoln Rockwell, received extensive media coverage through public demonstrations.
The ideology of National Renaissance Party leader James H. Mador was influenced by Blavatsky's Theosophy. Helena Blavatsky developed a theory of racial evolution, which held that the white race was a "fifth root race" called the Aryan race. According to Blavatsky, the Aryans were preceded by the Atlantians, who perished in the great flood that sank the continent of Atlantis. In Blavatsky's view, the three races that preceded the Atlanteans were proto-humans; they were the Lemurians, the Hyperboreans, and the first astral root race. Mador proposed a structure of governance based on the Hindu "Law of Manu" and its hierarchical caste system, based on the claim that the Aryan race had been worshipped as "white gods" from time immemorial.
The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, but courts have interpreted this very broadly to include hate speech, severely limiting the government's power to suppress speech. As a result, political groups are allowed great freedom to express Nazi, racist, and anti-Semitic views. A landmark First Amendment case is the National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie Village case. In this case, neo-Nazis threatened to march in a predominantly Jewish Chicago suburb. Although the march in Skokie did not materialize, the ruling allowed the neo-Nazis to stage a series of demonstrations in Chicago.
The Institute for Historical Review, formed in 1978, is a Holocaust denial organization associated with neo-Nazism.
Other organizations that report neo-Nazi activity in the U.S. that may involve attacks on or harassment of minorities include the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, both American organizations.

In 2022, famed rapper Kanye West stated that he is an avowed Nazi who denies the Holocaust and glorifies Adolf Hitler's policies.
Uruguay.
In 1998, in the Pocitos district of Montevideo, Uruguay, a group belonging to the "Joseph Goebbels Movement" attempted to burn down a synagogue that also served as a Hebrew school. An anti-Semitic pamphlet signed by this group was found in the building, which was saved by the quick action of firefighters. In addition, the Euroamericans, a racist and anti-Semitic neo-Nazi group formed in 1996, said when interviewed by La República de Montevideo that it was not involved in the synagogue attack, but the same Uruguayan group called "Poder Blanco" ("White Power"), a He revealed that he is in contact with the group and with neo-Nazi groups in Argentina and several European countries. Through the Internet, he has also obtained the solidarity of the Spanish-based pro-fascist group Patria. He also said that in the city of Canelones, Uruguay, 50 kilometers from Montevideo, there is a secret "Aryan church" that uses rituals adopted from the Ku Klux Klan. The Aryans have declared that they will not tolerate interracial or gay couples. One of the militants said in an interview, "If I see a black man with a white woman, I will break them up.
