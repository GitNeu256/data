Etymology
The "H" and "Y" letters in miHoYo's name come from the names of 2 founders, cai Haoyu and Luo Yuhao, and the "O" letter was added based on the inclusion of that letter in the names of famous companies such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft. Since "HoYo" has already been registered, "mi" of VOCALOID software Hatsune Miku has been added before the name. Hatsune Miku was chosen for her popularity among geeks.
Foundation
miHoYo started with Cai"Hugh" Haoyu, Liu "Forrest" Wei and Luo Yuhao, 3 computer science students from Shanghai Jiaotong University who were interested in technology and ACG (anime, manga and game) culture. Before establishing Mihoyo's name, the three people have worked on the project together. Their first project was the open source literary community, which won a 200,000 RMB scholarship in the contest.
In 2010, the team developed an isometric tile-based game engine called "Misato Engine" or "Misato2D" using adobe Flash Player. Misato Katsuragi, the character of the Japanese franchise Neon Genesis Evangelion, influenced the name. Using an upgraded version of the engine, they developed a game called Legend of Saha for the flash game development competition held during the 7th China Game Developers Conference (CGDC) on the 2nd month of the year. The team won the CNY30,000 prize offered by Shanda Games. Shanda Games outsourced them to develop a mini-game later called Bubble Hero.
Studio business
In 2011/1, 3 students set up miHoYo Studio in D32 university dormitories on campus. Later that year, Liu Wei, who represents the group, took part in the new entrepreneurial talent competition and won the third place. Mitoyo was awarded an office of 50 square meters, No.Located in 100 Qinzhou Road, the Eaglet of Shanghai Technology Entrepreneurship Foundation for six months term and RMB 100,000 graduates They moved from dormitory to office in 12 months. Each person had a desk on the wall, and in the center of the room sat a large table full of cartoons and light novels.
No one had artistic abilities, so Zhang Qinghua (张庆华), also known as Cici, got in touch on tencent's social media. At the time, Zhang was an undergraduate at the Guangdong Polytechnic University, the School of Art and Design, and the Department of Animation. He was late in his senior year when he met the founder of miHoYo in his internship. The first character he was commissioned to design was Kiana Kaslana, the protagonist of Flyme2Themoon. As the only artist on the team, he created all the artwork for their early titles. Zhang said the experience of working in the team dormitory:
I stayed in Wei's dormitory for a while. When I went out or watered, I had to secretly avoid the dorm supervisor. When I was about to graduate back to Guangzhou after work, the day I left the dormitory with my luggage, my boss took the initiative to say goodbye to me. In fact, she knew I wasn't a student here, but she didn't drive me away. This my first impression of Shanghai, very good.
Flyme2themoon
miHoYo launched Flyme2Themoon in the App Store as an independent developer on 28September2011. "Fly Me to the Moon", the ending theme song of the New Century Evangelion anime series, became the basis of the concept of the game. It inspired the team to create a puzzle game about "Magical Girl flying the moon"."This game was developed using Cocos2D software and the Box2D physics engine. The song for the game titled "Moon Trip" was composed by VOCALOID music producer Yu Jianliu, with lyrics written by lemonjolly. Yu used Hatsune Miku's voice bank for the song.
Flyme2themoon had little economic success, and the 3 founders only had a monthly income of 4,000 RMB. Looking for investors, Wei Liu represented the team in various university start-up contests. The non-mainstream status of Chinese anime and game culture posed challenges and also made it difficult for their group to be made up of university graduates. After being turned down in these contests, they finally got CNY1,000,000 Angel investment from Hangzhou Sky Network Technology Co., Ltd. It was Mihoyo's only external funding.
Establishment of the company and Hokai Gakuen
On13February2012,Shanghai miHoYo Network Technology Co. N T T Co., Ltd. was officially established. Jin Zhicheng, a member of the Flyme2Themoon development team, presented a presentation at Cisco Systems (China) Research & Development Co., Ltd. on May 3.I left to recruit jobs in. He transferred his shares to Liu Wei and Luo Yuhao. During that time, Jin did a small amount of program development work and did not participate in the management of the company. Zhang Tsinghua worked first as an artist at 4399 Network Co., Ltd. Prior to joining Sanyo Co., Ltd., he worked as an art director and supervisor in 2012/2. Cai Haoyu legally represents the company and serves as its chairman and General Manager. He is both a controlling shareholder and a real administrator. Liu Wei and Luo Yu Bao serve as directors. Tsai is miHoYo's largest shareholder, with Liu and Luo controlling 22.6% and 21.4% respectively. Hangzhou Miyi Investment Co., Ltd. Ltd. has the remaining 15% of NTY shares.
Moving from Flyme2Themoon, the team imagined a more successful game. Inspired by a shared interest in the side-scrolling shooter game "Zombie Town" and the Japanese anime and manga series "High School of the Dead," the company created its first game since its inception, "Zombie Gal Kawaii." The project started in 2011-12 and the team took 4-5 months to create a demo of the game 3 times. This game was developed with the Unity engine (version 3.2-3.5) and Autodesk Maya computer graphics software. Within the next 8 months, they expanded the gameplay with adjusted values and an added system. The first version of the game appeared in 2012-11, and the first public test took place in 12 months.
Houkai Gakuen 2
There are many reasons why we created Takarumi Gakuen. When making this type of game, I didn't think much about the details. We did it because we wanted to create a game that we wanted to play. We made our own because we found that the top-ranked games on the App Store did not have the kind of games we wanted to play. The reason is simple. - Kai Haoyu, 2014
Released in 2013/6 "Takarai Gakuen 2or Guns Girl Z" is an arcade action game released in 2013/6. Later in the 8th month, the team began working on designing and generating the server architecture. Work on peripheral systems and game graphics was carried out on 11 May. Compared to the Hokai Gakuen, the development time of Hokai Gakuen 2 was shortened due to the use of basic data, art assets and core gameplay from the previous work. The core gameplay was further developed by copying and transforming the game's system into a puzzle and dragon action game, the process was taken from Treasure Sea Gakuen for 3 months and the content was expanded with the addition of new characters, weapons and sets of clothing. The test took place in 2014/1/26, and the game was released on the Bilibili platform on 3 May.
The game had some financial success, but there were many technical issues that were difficult to manage with a team of just 7 people, such as top-up failures and server downtime. Eventually, the company decided to hire players as staff. That same year, the Honkai Impact3rd project was launched at the same time that the company envisioned the "Honkai universe.""
Hongkai Impact 3rd
The Impact 3rd Project was launched in 2014. 7/6, I attended the GameLook Game Open Day conference held in Shanghai and gave a lecture on the development and promotion of Baohai Gakuen 2. In the speech, he said the team is working on the third edition of the Treasure Sea Academy, and its core gameplay is ongoing.
In 2015/3, miHoYo began developing an engine for games. They created a physics-based animation system; it can simulate the performance of various bodies based on physical formulas, showing more realistic character movements and destructive scene effects. You can also fix sharp transitions between animations to make the animation smoother and more natural. In addition, we have developed technologies for 3D modeling, light mapping, real-time and pre-rendering systems. Content production for the game began in 2015/10. It was the game series Bayonetta and Devil May Cry that had a creative impact on the combat gameplay. The development team also studied games like Guilty Gear Xrd using 3D cell shading. Moving from 2D to 3D was a challenge because the members of the team didn't know how to do a 3D project. It took 6 months to create the artwork, models and animations for Kiana Caslana. After the test run, the team discarded the work and rebooted from scratch to establish the current system.
Honkai Impact3rd released an internal iOS beta in 2016, launched on May 3, tested publicly, and released on May 9, 10. Regular characters such as Kiana Kaslana, Raiden Mei and Bronya Zaychik appear in a different story than in previous games. Its gameplay includes role play and hack and slash action, and also features gacha mechanics. In addition to the game, it was followed by multiple supplementary media such as animated series, graphic novels, comics and promotional videos. miHoYo's early titles were successful in Asia, but did not reach global success until the release of Honkai Impact3rd. The server of 2017/2/22 (Japan), 2017/5/18 (Taiwan), 2017/10/17 (Korea), 2017/11/1 (Southeast Asia), 2018/3/28 (North America and Europe) was opened. After being a mobile-only game, Honkai Impact3rd is now available on PC in 2019/12/26.
Corporate Growth and Risk
Within 2 years of the release of "Honkai Impact3rd", the company with 7 human bodies began to include about 200 employees. More than 100 people were involved in research and development. The average age of these employees was 29 years old, and employees under the age of 30 accounted for 84% of our employees. After 4 years, the number of employees exceeded 1,000.
In 2017/2/15, miHoYo applied for an initial public offering (IPO) to the China Securities Regulatory Commission when it was planning to raise more than 10 billion yuan. In the process, some concerns were noted, such as the company's reliance on a single intellectual property, the Honkai series. The main source of income was the 2nd division of Hokai Gakuen, which accounted for 96.34%. The risk is that the company will not be able to continue to launch new products to meet the needs of players or update the content of the game, and face the loss of users Another problem is that the company will not be able to grasp the change in preferences, and the Honkai series may lose its appeal. On the 19th, Miho submitted the latest prospectus, which included Honkai Impact 3 in its earnings, and it became Hokai Gakuen 2, which accounted for 98.82%. For unknown reasons, miHoYo withdrew its IPO application in 2020.
Official Gamer Forum
In 2018/11, miHoYo launched the official gamer community Mihoyo, also known as Mihoyo BBS. While it is used to popularize official game information and event peripherals, it also features practical tools for players such as calculators and character building simulations. It also serves as a content creation platform for players. The miHoYo Forum, the global counterpart of the miHoYo Bulletin Board, was launched in 2020/1/16. It was announced as the official forum of Haragami Impact. Then I got a new brand "HoYoLAB"."The HoYoLAB app was launched from 2021/6/1 with closed beta testing starting at 7/15. In the Chinese forum, the mascot Miyouji was revealed in 2020 at 4.30 am. Miyoko has a variety of themed outfits following Miyoko's game, including Hokai Gakuen 2, Honkai Impact3rd, Tears of Themis, and Genshin Impact. Next to the Miyoji, there is a rabbit that appears in the logo of the forum. HoYoLAB's mascot is Mimo, which also appears as a logo.
Tears of Themis
Tears of Themis is a game developed by miHoYo that combines elements of romance and detective. The game released its first PV in 2019/7/29. Pre-registration began in 2020/7/29, and it was officially released in 2020/7/30. The game conducted a closed beta test of the international version in 2021/4 and 5 months, began pre-registration on 6 months, reaching more than 650,000 pre-registrations. This game won the Pocket Gamer People's Choice Award in 2022. The game takes place in 2030, in a sci-fi setting in the fictional city of Stellis. The player will play as a working female defense attorney with 4 men's love interests to solve the case.
Genshin Impact
When in 2016/9 Honkai Impact3rd went online and achieved certain results, I began to think about what the next product would be like, and kept thinking about it for about half a year. For most of the first half of 2017, we were very anxious. What products will we find "exciting" and "out of imagination."So we went back to the beginning and the question, "What kind of game do you want to play?""During that period, what we were playing the most was the open world games, and all of these games were characterized by a huge world and exploration experience that exceeded our expectations. So why don't we do it because we want to play these games, and are willing to make this kind of game. It was in 2017 with this simple feeling that we started working on this project. But we later realized that we had greatly underestimated the difficulty of creating an open world. -Liu Wei, 2020
Genshin Impact began development in 2017/1 under the working title "崩坏4" (pinyin: Búnghuài4; "Honkai4"). At that time, producer Cai Haoyu considered creating a new project to strengthen miHoYo's core R&D capabilities and presented the players with products with significant quality improvements in the future. The idea of creating an open world game came out of it. During the next 7 months, the team tried several prototypes. After Kai played Nintendo's Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the team took inspiration from the experience of exploring the game's world. Other inspiration came from random events in Grand Theft Auto, Divinity Strategy: Original Sin, the game developer's naughty dog.
The production team initially had 150 people. They underestimated the difficulty of creating an open world, so by mid-2019 it had grown to 300 people, by 2020-4 to 500 people, and by 2021-2 to 700 people. The project's R&D costs began at225 million, then exceeded1100 million and were recovered two weeks after the release of the game. Much of the game's budget was invested in music production. Yu-Peng Chen, also known as Chen Zhiyi, participated in the project as a music producer and composed scores for the Mondstadt and Liyue regions. Zhang Qinghua served as Senior Art Director.
Genshin Impact conducted its first beta test in 2019/6 focusing on core gameplay mechanisms and the Mondstadt region. In early 2020, overseas promotion of the game was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The development was also delayed by 1 month because telecommuting was almost impossible and employees had no access to office equipment. The second beta test came in May and featured Liyue, and then the third beta test came in May. The game was released in 2020/9/28.
Lumi and N0Va Desktop
Lumi (stylized as yoyo Lumi) is a virtual actress and YouTuber created by miHoYo, an attempt by miHoYo in another area of anime culture.

Later, miHoYo officially revealed his identity with Lumi when it released the 2020/8/4 dynamic desktop wallpaper software "N0Va Desktop". In 2022/7/15, Rumi launched its first live stream in bilibili and quickly surpassed the popular list of bilibili live streams. The 30-minute live stream attracted a total of 660 million viewers.
