Z26 was one of 15 Type 1936A destroyers built for the German Navy during World War II. she was completed in early 1941 and served in Norwegian waters. she first arrived in Norway in November, but suffered engine trouble and had to return to Germany for repairs in January 1942. Z26 returned to Norway two months later and became the flagship of the Destroyer Flotilla, which with her two sisters attempted to intercept Convoy PQ 13, rescuing survivors from an already sunken ship before Z26 sank one that had strayed from the convoy, The cruiser's torpedoes damaged the Z26; the pursuit of the Z26 was taken over by a British destroyer, and as the Z26 was badly damaged, drifting and on fire, two other German destroyers arrived at the right moment and prevented the British ships from sinking the Z26. They were able to rescue 88 survivors, and the submarine later rescued eight others.
Design and Description
The Type 1936A destroyers were slightly larger and heavier armed than the preceding Type 1936 class. It was 127 meters (416 feet 8 inches) long and 121.90 meters (399 feet 11 inches) at the draft line. The beam was 12 meters (39 feet 4 inches) and the maximum draft was 4.62 meters (15 feet 2 inches). Two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving a single propeller shaft, were capable of producing 70,000 PS (51, 000 kW; 69,000 kW) using steam supplied from six Wagner water tube boilers. The Z26 was designed to generate 70,000 kW (51, 000 kW; 69,000 shp), with a design speed of 36 knots (67 km/h; 41 mph). miles) range. The crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors.
She was armed with one 15cm TbtsK C/36 cannon forward of the superstructure and three aft. Antiaircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm C/30 guns mounted on two mounts next to the rear funnel and five 2 cm C/30 guns on a single mount; Z26 carried eight overwater 53.3 cm torpedo tubes on two powered mounts. Two reloads were provided on each mount. She was also equipped with a mine track on the aft deck that could carry up to 60 mines. A "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) passive hydrophone was fitted to detect submarines and probably also S-Gerät sonar. The upper bridge was equipped with a FuMO 24/25 radar.
Construction and Career
Z26 was ordered from AG Weser (Deschimag) on April 23, 1938; she was laid down on April 1, 1939 at the Bremen shipyard in Deschimag as yard number W960, launched on April 2, 1940, and commissioned on January 9, 1941. From 23 to 29 September, the Baltic Fleet, temporarily formed around the battleship Tirpitz, sailed into the Åland Sea to escort the Soviet red-flag Baltic Fleet in its attempt to escape from the Gulf of Finland.
On November 9, Z26 and her sister ship Z24 sailed for northern Norway. At Tromsø, the lubrication pump on the starboard low-pressure turbine failed, destroying a rotor blade; repairs were completed by December 14, and the ship joined her sister ships of Destroyer Squadron 8 at Kirkenes, but another lubrication pump failed, preventing her from participating in a planned sortie off Murmansk. Still plagued by mechanical problems, Z26 departed for Germany on January 5, 1942, for refit. The refit was completed and on March 18 she escorted the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper from Brunsbüttel, Germany, to Trondheim, Norway, then the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer from Trondheim to Narvik, arriving at Kirkenes on the 27th.
On March 28, Z26, flagship of 8. Flotilla captain Gottfried Pönitz, sailed from Varangerfjord with her sister ships Z24 and Z25 to intercept Convoy PQ13. Late that night, they rescued the 61 survivors of the sunken freighter SS Empire Ranger and then sank the stray 4,687 gross ton (GRT) freighter SS Bateau, which Z26 attacked with gunfire and finished off with torpedoes. The Germans rescued seven survivors before resuming the search for the convoy. The light cruiser HMS Trinidad, escorted by the destroyer HMS Fury, spotted the German ship on radar at 08:49 on the 29th and was herself spotted at the same time. Both sides opened fire at close range, 3,200 yards (2,900 meters), in a blizzard. Trinidad engaged the lead German destroyer, Z26, and hit her with a second shell from her forward gun. Her shell destroyed two 15cm guns, damaged the port turbine room, and caused a large fire. The destroyer fired 19 torpedoes at the cruiser, but all missed after Trinidad turned away. Both sides maneuvered to avoid the torpedoes and were forced to break away, accidentally pulling Z26 away from her sister. Trinidad's radar spotted the damaged destroyer and the cruiser altered course and increased speed to intercept; at 09:17, at a range of 2900 yards (2700 m), it opened fire on the wildly maneuvering Z26, but only three of its 37 main guns hit the target. In an attempt to finish off the badly damaged destroyer, Trinidad fired one torpedo five minutes later; one torpedo turned and hit Trinidad, damaging the cruiser. The German destroyer attempted to break away, but the Fury, which had not yet fired during the battle, gave chase.
Z26 passed by three destroyers escorting the convoy, but only two Soviet ships, Sokrushitel'nyy and Gremyashchiy, fired on her through the snow. Fury fired two shots at Eclipse at 09:30, but to no avail, recognizing Eclipse as a friend and turning back to provide support to Trinidad. Eclipse then began pursuit, and radar spotted Z26 at a range of about 2 nautical miles (3.7 km; 2.3 miles). When the range was reduced to 800 yards (730 m), it opened fire. The German ship attempted to break away behind a smoke screen but was unsuccessful as Eclipse continued to hit; after the sixth hit, Z26 lost power at 10:20 and tilted to port, flooding her stern. The British destroyer maneuvered to finish off the German destroyer with a final torpedo, but when the blizzard ended and visibility improved, Z24 and Z25 were seen approaching; at 10:35, before they had time to duck under a squall, Z24 and Z25 opened fire on Eclipse, hitting her twice and wounding nine men. The German ships did not pursue Eclipse, preferring to rescue the 88 survivors. The German submarine U-376 later rescued eight more, but 243 of the crew were killed.
