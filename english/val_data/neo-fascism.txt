Neo-fascism is a post-World War II far-right ideology that includes key elements of fascism. Neo-fascism usually includes opposition to ultranationalism, racial supremacy, populism, authoritarianism, nativism, xenophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, liberal democracy, social democracy, parliamentarism, liberalism, Marxism, capitalism, communism, and socialism. Like classical fascism, it advocates a third position as an alternative to market capitalism.
Claims that a group is neo-fascist can be heavily contested, especially when the term is used as a political pejorative. Some post-World War II regimes have been described as neo-fascist because of their authoritarian nature and their admiration and sympathy for the ideology and rituals of fascism.
History
According to Jean-Yves Camus and Nicolas Lebourg, neo-fascist ideology emerged in 1942 after Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union and reoriented its propaganda toward Europeanism. Europe then became both a myth and a utopia for the neo-fascists, who abandoned their previous theories of racial inequality within the white race after World War II in order to share the Euro-nationalist stance symbolized by Oswald Mosley's "Europe is a nation" policy The "Europe is a Nation" policy of Oswald Mosley. The Euro-nationalist movement was to be divided into three distinct phases: the ideological formation prior to 1919, the historical experience of fascism from 1919 to 1942, and neo-fascism after 1942.
Inspired by the Italian Social Republic, institutional neo-fascism took the form of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), which until the late 1980s became one of the main reference points of the European far right and, in the words of political scientist Cas Mudde, "the best (and only example" of a neo-fascist party, in the words of political scientist Cas Mudde. Led by MSI, the European Social Movement was founded in 1951 as a pan-European organization of like-minded neofascist groups and figures, including the Francoist Phalange, Maurice Bardèche, Pere Engdahl, and Oswald Mosley. Other organizations, such as Junta Nacion, called for an extra-parliamentary revolt against the regime in the late 1950s, a vestige of the prewar fascist strategy. The main impetus of the neo-fascist movement was to defend Western civilization against the rise of communism and the Third World, and in some cases the loss of colonial empires.
In 1961, Bardèche published Qu'est-ce que le fascisme. (What is Fascism?). He argued that the earlier fascists had essentially made two mistakes. They focused on "method" rather than on the original "idea," and they mistakenly believed that a fascist society could be achieved through nation-states, as opposed to the construction of Europe. According to him, fascism could survive the 20th century in a new metaphysical guise if its theorists succeeded in constructing an original method adapted to the changing times: furthermore, Bardesch argued that "a single party, a secret police, an open display of Caesarism, even the presence of a Führer, are not necessarily not attributes of fascism. The well-known methods of fascism have been constantly modified and will continue to be modified. More important than the mechanism is the idea that fascism has created for itself about man and freedom. With another name, another face, nothing that betrays a projection from the past, the Knights of Sparta will be reborn with the appearance of an unrecognizable child and the head of a young Medusa. "
In the spirit of Bardeş's strategy of disguise by changing the framework, MSI developed a policy of inseriment (insert, entryism), which relied on gaining political acceptance through cooperation with other parties within the democratic system. In the political context of the Cold War, anticommunism replaced anti-fascism and began to become the dominant current in liberal democracies. In Italy, MSI became a support group in the parliament of the Christian Democratic government in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but anti-fascist protests and violent street clashes between radical left and far-right groups drove it into a "political ghetto," and in July 1960 In July, the Tamburroni cabinet, which had gained fascist support in a short period of time, collapsed.
According to David Pabón-Cuéral, a psychologist at the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo, with the rise of neoliberalism in the late 20th century, neoliberal politicians authoritatively removed all restrictions on capital (including labor laws, social rights, and tariffs), through an aestheticization of politics, They also began to use neo-fascism not to protect all individuals, but to maintain social hierarchies, by exploiting the narcissism of small differences to find exploitable targets for their hatred.
Causes and Explanations
Many historians and political scientists have noted that the situation in European countries during the 1980s and 1990s, particularly France, Germany, and Italy, resembles that of Europe between World War I and World War II. The constant economic crisis, including high unemployment, the resurgence of nationalism, the increase in ethnic conflicts, and the geopolitical weakening of national regimes were all present and did not correspond exactly one to one, but the situation was similar enough to facilitate the beginning of neo-fascism as a new fascist movement. Since strong nationalism is almost always part of neo-fascism, the parties that make up this movement are not pan-European, but are specific to each country.
While certainly fascistic, some argue that there is a difference between neo-fascism and what is called "historical fascism," that is, the kind of neo-fascism that emerged immediately after World War II. Some historians argue that modern neo-fascist parties are not anti-democratic because they operate within their own political systems. Some scholars point out that Hitler came to power within the existing political system of the Weimar Republic, which was anti-democratic. Others point out that today's neo-fascists are not totalitarian in character, but their party organization along the lines of the SS Führer seems to indicate otherwise. Historian Stanley G. Paine argues that the differences between the interwar period and the current situation, as well as the strengthening of democracy in postwar European countries, have prevented a general revival of historical fascism, keeping true neofascist groups small and peripheral. For Paine, groups such as France's National Front are not essentially neo-fascist, but merely "right radical parties" that moderate their positions over time in order to win elections.
Whether called "foreigners," "foreign workers," "economic refugees," "ethnic minorities," "asylum seekers," or "aliens," the issue of immigration, whether legal, illegal, or irregular, is at the core of the neo-fascists' problems, and their nativism, ultranationalism, xenophobia It is closely linked, but its specifics vary somewhat from country to country, depending on the prevailing circumstances. Typically, anti-immigrant sentiment rises when the economy is sluggish or unemployment is high, and people are afraid of losing their jobs to outsiders. For this reason, neo-fascist parties attract more electoral support during economically difficult times. This mirrors, for example, the situation in the interwar period, when Germany suffered from tremendous hyperinflation and many people had their savings withdrawn. In contemporary Europe, mainstream parties, realizing that neo-fascist and far-right parties can gain electoral advantage by emphasizing outsider issues, try to draw voters away from the hard right by moving the immigration issue somewhat to the right. Since there was no strong socialist movement in postwar Europe, the political center tends to lean to the right overall.
Both historical fascism and contemporary neo-fascism espouse xenophobia, nationalism, and anti-immigration, but neo-fascist leaders are careful not to present these views in such a strong manner that they bear obvious similarities to historical events. Neither Jean-Marie Le Pen of France's "National Front" nor Jörg Haider of Austria's "Freedom Party" "reveal their prejudices only indirectly," in the words of historian Tony Judt. Jews are not condemned as a group, but are specifically named as dangerous individuals who just happen to be Jewish. The main difference between neo-fascists and historical fascists is the public presentation of their leaders. Modern neo-fascists do not appear in "jackboots and brown shirts," but in suits and ties. The leaders of the various groups make deliberate choices to distinguish themselves from the brutal leaders of historical fascism and to conceal the pedigree and connections of their current leaders to the historical fascist movement. If they become public, as in Haider's case, it will lead to their decline and downfall.
International Networks
In 1951, the New European Order (NEO) Neo-Fascist Alliance for All of Europe was founded to promote pan-European nationalism. It was a more radical offshoot group of the European social movement. The NEO had its origins in the Malmö Conference of 1951, when dissidents led by René Binet and Maurice Bardèche refused to participate because they felt that the European Social Movement was insufficient in terms of racism and anticommunism. As a result, Binet, along with Gaston-Armand Amadouleuse at the second meeting in Zurich that same year, launched a second group pledging war against communists and non-whites.
Several Cold War regimes and international neo-fascist movements collaborated in the operation, including assassinations and false flag bombings. Stefano Delle Chiae, involved in Italy's "Years of Lead," participated in "Operation Condor," which organized the 1976 assassination attempt on Chilean Christian Democrat Bernardo Leighton. Vincenzo Vinciguerra escaped to Frankist Spain with the help of SISMI after the 1972 Peteano attack and was sentenced to life in prison for his crime. Along with Delle Chiaie, Vinciguerra was sentenced in December 1995 in Rome before Judge Maria Cervini de Cubria to life in prison for the assassination of Enrique Arancibia Clavell (a former Chilean secret police agent indicted for crimes against humanity in 2004) and Michael Townley, a DINA agent stationed in the United States, who was testified that they were directly involved in the assassination of General Carlos Prats. Michael Townley was sentenced to 15 years in prison in Italy for acting as an intermediary between DINA and Italian neo-fascists.
The regimes of Francoist Spain, Augusto Pinochet's Chile, and Alfredo Stroessner's Paraguay participated together in Operation Condor, which targeted political enemies around the world. During the Cold War, these international operations spawned various neo-fascist collaborations engaged in a "crusade against communism." Anti-Fidel Castro terrorist Luis Posada Carriles was blamed for the bombing of Cuban Airlines Flight 455 on October 6, 1976. According to the Miami Herald, the bombing was decided at the same meeting that decided to target former Chilean minister Orlando Letelier, who was assassinated on September 21, 1976. Carriles wrote in his autobiography, "We Cubans were not opposed to an isolated tyranny or to a particular regime in our homeland, but we had a huge enemy in front of us.
