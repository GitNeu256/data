Neo-fascism is a post-World War II far-right ideology that includes key elements of fascism. Neo-fascism usually includes opposition to ultranationalism, racial supremacy, populism, authoritarianism, nativism, xenophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, liberal democracy, social democracy, parliamentarism, liberalism, Marxism, capitalism, communism, and socialism. Like classical fascism, it advocates a third position as an alternative to market capitalism.
Claims that a group is neo-fascist can be heavily contested, especially when the term is used as a political pejorative. Some post-World War II regimes have been described as neo-fascist because of their authoritarian nature and their admiration and sympathy for the ideology and rituals of fascism.
History
According to Jean-Yves Camus and Nicolas Lebourg, neo-fascist ideology emerged in 1942 after Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union and reoriented its propaganda toward Europeanism. Europe then became both a myth and a utopia for the neo-fascists, who abandoned their previous theories of racial inequality within the white race after World War II in order to share the Euro-nationalist stance symbolized by Oswald Mosley's "Europe is a nation" policy The "Europe is a Nation" policy of Oswald Mosley. The Euro-nationalist movement was to be divided into three distinct phases: the ideological formation prior to 1919, the historical experience of fascism from 1919 to 1942, and neo-fascism after 1942.
Inspired by the Italian Social Republic, institutional neo-fascism took the form of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), which until the late 1980s became one of the main reference points of the European far right and, in the words of political scientist Cas Mudde, "the best (and only example" of a neo-fascist party, in the words of political scientist Cas Mudde. Led by MSI, the European Social Movement was founded in 1951 as a pan-European organization of like-minded neofascist groups and figures, including the Francoist Phalange, Maurice Bardèche, Pere Engdahl, and Oswald Mosley. Other organizations, such as Junta Nacion, called for an extra-parliamentary revolt against the regime in the late 1950s, a vestige of the prewar fascist strategy. The main impetus of the neo-fascist movement was to defend Western civilization against the rise of communism and the Third World, and in some cases the loss of colonial empires.
In 1961, Bardèche published Qu'est-ce que le fascisme. (What is Fascism?). He argued that the earlier fascists had essentially made two mistakes. They focused on "method" rather than on the original "idea," and they mistakenly believed that a fascist society could be achieved through nation-states, as opposed to the construction of Europe. According to him, fascism could survive the 20th century in a new metaphysical guise if its theorists succeeded in constructing an original method adapted to the changing times: furthermore, Bardesch argued that "a single party, a secret police, an open display of Caesarism, even the presence of a Führer, are not necessarily not attributes of fascism. The well-known methods of fascism have been constantly modified and will continue to be modified. More important than the mechanism is the idea that fascism has created for itself about man and freedom. With another name, another face, nothing that betrays a projection from the past, the Knights of Sparta will be reborn with the appearance of an unrecognizable child and the head of a young Medusa. "
In the spirit of Bardeş's strategy of disguise by changing the framework, MSI developed a policy of inseriment (insert, entryism), which relied on gaining political acceptance through cooperation with other parties within the democratic system. In the political context of the Cold War, anticommunism replaced anti-fascism and began to become the dominant current in liberal democracies. In Italy, MSI became a support group in the parliament of the Christian Democratic government in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but anti-fascist protests and violent street clashes between radical left and far-right groups drove it into a "political ghetto," and in July 1960 In July, the Tamburroni cabinet, which had gained fascist support in a short period of time, collapsed.
According to David Pabón-Cuéral, a psychologist at the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo, with the rise of neoliberalism in the late 20th century, neoliberal politicians authoritatively removed all restrictions on capital (including labor laws, social rights, and tariffs), through an aestheticization of politics, They also began to use neo-fascism not to protect all individuals, but to maintain social hierarchies, by exploiting the narcissism of small differences to find exploitable targets for their hatred.
Causes and Explanations
Many historians and political scientists have noted that the situation in European countries during the 1980s and 1990s, particularly France, Germany, and Italy, resembles that of Europe between World War I and World War II. The constant economic crisis, including high unemployment, the resurgence of nationalism, the increase in ethnic conflicts, and the geopolitical weakening of national regimes were all present and did not correspond exactly one to one, but the situation was similar enough to facilitate the beginning of neo-fascism as a new fascist movement. Since strong nationalism is almost always part of neo-fascism, the parties that make up this movement are not pan-European, but are specific to each country.
While certainly fascistic, some argue that there is a difference between neo-fascism and what is called "historical fascism," that is, the kind of neo-fascism that emerged immediately after World War II. Some historians argue that modern neo-fascist parties are not anti-democratic because they operate within their own political systems. Some scholars point out that Hitler came to power within the existing political system of the Weimar Republic, which was anti-democratic. Others point out that today's neo-fascists are not totalitarian in character, but their party organization along the lines of the SS Führer seems to indicate otherwise. Historian Stanley G. Paine argues that the differences between the interwar period and the current situation, as well as the strengthening of democracy in postwar European countries, have prevented a general revival of historical fascism, keeping true neofascist groups small and peripheral. For Paine, groups such as France's National Front are not essentially neo-fascist, but merely "right radical parties" that moderate their positions over time in order to win elections.
Whether called "foreigners," "foreign workers," "economic refugees," "ethnic minorities," "asylum seekers," or "aliens," the issue of immigration, whether legal, illegal, or irregular, is at the core of the neo-fascists' problems, and their nativism, ultranationalism, xenophobia It is closely linked, but its specifics vary somewhat from country to country, depending on the prevailing circumstances. Typically, anti-immigrant sentiment rises when the economy is sluggish or unemployment is high, and people are afraid of losing their jobs to outsiders. For this reason, neo-fascist parties attract more electoral support during economically difficult times. This mirrors, for example, the situation in the interwar period, when Germany suffered from tremendous hyperinflation and many people had their savings withdrawn. In contemporary Europe, mainstream parties, realizing that neo-fascist and far-right parties can gain electoral advantage by emphasizing outsider issues, try to draw voters away from the hard right by moving the immigration issue somewhat to the right. Since there was no strong socialist movement in postwar Europe, the political center tends to lean to the right overall.
Both historical fascism and contemporary neo-fascism espouse xenophobia, nationalism, and anti-immigration, but neo-fascist leaders are careful not to present these views in such a strong manner that they bear obvious similarities to historical events. Neither Jean-Marie Le Pen of France's "National Front" nor Jörg Haider of Austria's "Freedom Party" "reveal their prejudices only indirectly," in the words of historian Tony Judt. Jews are not condemned as a group, but are specifically named as dangerous individuals who just happen to be Jewish. The main difference between neo-fascists and historical fascists is the public presentation of their leaders. Modern neo-fascists do not appear in "jackboots and brown shirts," but in suits and ties. The leaders of the various groups make deliberate choices to distinguish themselves from the brutal leaders of historical fascism and to conceal the pedigree and connections of their current leaders to the historical fascist movement. If they become public, as in Haider's case, it will lead to their decline and downfall.
International Networks
In 1951, the New European Order (NEO) Neo-Fascist Alliance for All of Europe was founded to promote pan-European nationalism. It was a more radical offshoot group of the European social movement. The NEO had its origins in the Malmö Conference of 1951, when dissidents led by René Binet and Maurice Bardèche refused to participate because they felt that the European Social Movement was insufficient in terms of racism and anticommunism. As a result, Binet, along with Gaston-Armand Amadouleuse at the second meeting in Zurich that same year, launched a second group pledging war against communists and non-whites.
Several Cold War regimes and international neo-fascist movements collaborated in the operation, including assassinations and false flag bombings. Stefano Delle Chiae, involved in Italy's "Years of Lead," participated in "Operation Condor," which organized the 1976 assassination attempt on Chilean Christian Democrat Bernardo Leighton. Vincenzo Vinciguerra escaped to Frankist Spain with the help of SISMI after the 1972 Peteano attack and was sentenced to life in prison for his crime. Along with Delle Chiaie, Vinciguerra was sentenced in December 1995 in Rome before Judge Maria Cervini de Cubria to life in prison for the assassination of Enrique Arancibia Clavell (a former Chilean secret police agent indicted for crimes against humanity in 2004) and Michael Townley, a DINA agent stationed in the United States, who was testified that they were directly involved in the assassination of General Carlos Prats. Michael Townley was sentenced to 15 years in prison in Italy for acting as an intermediary between DINA and Italian neo-fascists.
The regimes of Francoist Spain, Augusto Pinochet's Chile, and Alfredo Stroessner's Paraguay participated together in Operation Condor, which targeted political enemies around the world. During the Cold War, these international operations spawned various neo-fascist collaborations engaged in a "crusade against communism." Anti-Fidel Castro terrorist Luis Posada Carriles was blamed for the bombing of Cuban Airlines Flight 455 on October 6, 1976. According to the Miami Herald, the bombing was decided at the same meeting that decided to target former Chilean minister Orlando Letelier, who was assassinated on September 21, 1976. Carriles wrote in his autobiography, "We Cubans were not opposed to an isolated tyranny or to a particular regime in our homeland, but we had a huge enemy in front of us.
.
Europe
Finland.
In Finland, neo-fascism is often associated with the fascist and pro-Nazi Patriotic People's Movement (IKL) of the 1930s and 1940s, its youth movement, the Blue and Black, and its predecessor, the Lapua movement. Postwar fascist groups such as the Patriotic People's Movement (1993), the Patriotic People's Front, the Patriotic National Movement, and the Blue and Black Movement consciously emulated the style of this movement and looked to its leaders as inspiration. A Finnish party member and police officer in Seinajoki caused a small scandal by wearing a fascist blue and black uniform.
Italy.
After World War II, Italy was divided into two main political blocs: the Christian Democrats, who remained in power until the 1990s, and the Italian Communist Party (PCI), which rose to power immediately after the war and gained significant consensus in the 1970s. When the Cold War began, the U.S. and British governments turned a blind eye to the Italian authorities' refusal to extradite Italian war criminals to Yugoslavia, fearing that this would benefit the PCI. Because events like the Nuremberg Trials did not occur regarding Italian war crimes, the collective memory of the crimes committed by Italian fascists was excluded from the public media, from Italian school textbooks, and even from the Western academic discourse of the Iron Curtain throughout the Cold War The PCI was founded in May 1947 by the In May, along with the French Communist Party (PCF), it was ousted from power a month before the Paris Conference on the Marshall Plan.
In 1946, a group of Italian fascist soldiers founded the Italian Socialist Movement (MSI), which continued to advocate the ideas of Benito Mussolini; the leader of MSI was Giorgio Almirante, who headed the party until his death in 1988. In December 1970, Junio Valerio Borghese, together with Stefano Delle Chiae, attempted the Borghese coup, which would have established a neo-fascist government. The neo-fascist group participated in various false flag terrorist attacks, beginning with the Piazza Fontana massacre in December 1969, for which Vincenzo Vinciguerra was convicted.
In 1987, the leadership of the MSI was taken over by Gianfranco Fini, and under Fini the party was dissolved in 1995 and replaced by the National Alliance (AN). The Fini-led party distanced itself from Mussolini and fascism, worked to improve relations with the Jewish community, and remained a conservative right-wing party until 2009, when it merged with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia to form the center-right party, People of Freedom. Italy's neo-fascist parties include the Tricolore (Fiamma Tricolore), the New Forces (Forza Nuova), the National Social Front (Fronte Sociale Nazionale), and the CasaPound (CasaPound); the national conservative Italian brothers who succeeded MSI and AN (FdI), described by some scholars as neo-fascist and with neo-fascist factions in its internal organization, the result of the Italian general election of 2022, in which FdI became the leading party, has been variously described as the first far-right-led Italian government in the republican era and the most right-wing government since World War II. The Russo-Ukrainian war led to the Italian far right, including neo-fascists, being divided into three clusters: the pro-Western and Atlanticist far right (such as Casa Pound), the nostalgic and pro-Putin neo-fascism (New Force), and the ideologically evolving ethnic Bolshevik and Eurasianist radical clique. It was divided into three clusters. Greece.
After the Great Recession and economic crisis in Greece, a movement known widely as "Golden Dawn," a neo-Nazi party, surged in popularity from obscurity and won seats in the Greek Parliament on a platform of strong hostility toward minorities, illegal immigrants, and refugees. In 2013, following the murder of an anti-fascist musician by a person associated with Golden Dawn, the Greek government ordered the arrest of Golden Dawn leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos and other Golden Dawn members in connection with the criminal organization. and convicted 68 members of various crimes, including murder. However, far-right politics remain strong in Greece, including the ultranationalist party "Greeks for the Fatherland" led by Ilias Kasidiaris In 2021, Greek neo-Nazi youth attacked a rival group in a Greek school
Portugal.
The collapse of Portuguese authoritarianism after the Carnation Revolution of 1974 spawned several neo-fascist groups, including the New Order (Portugal), which was formed in 1978. A European Parliament report defined the New Order's ideology as revolutionary fascist and ultranationalist. The group also had ties to Fuerza Nueva in Spain. The New Order disbanded in 1982, but its activities continued until 1985.
Romania.
In Romania, the ultranationalist movement allied with the Axis powers and German National Socialism was the Iron Guard, also known as the Legion of the Archangel Michael. There are also several contemporary political organizations that self-identify as successors to Legionarism, such as the Noua Dreaptă or "For the Fatherland" party, founded by former Iron Guard members. The latter organization was outlawed in 2015. Besides these Romanian organizations, the Sixty-four County Youth Movement, which represents the ultra-nationalism of the Hungarian minority, is also present, especially in Transylvania. Other nationalist and independentist groups, such as the Greater Romania Party, do not derive from legionarism, but actually evolved from the ethnocommunist tendencies of Nicolae Ceauşescu's time (the party was founded by his "court poet" Corneliu Vadim Tudor).
Russia.
In 1990, Vladimir Zhirinovsky founded the Russian Liberal Democratic Party. The party's leadership opposes democratic values, human rights, a multiparty system, and the rule of law. The Encyclopedia Britannica considers Zhirinovsky a neo-fascist. Zhirinovsky supported the forced reoccupation of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia and proposed dumping nuclear waste there; during the first Chechen conflict in the mid-1990s, he advocated attacking Chechen villages with tactical nuclear weapons.
Russian National Unity is a paramilitary organization founded by Aleksandr Barkashov in 1990. It uses a left-pointing swastika and emphasizes the "primary importance" of Russian blood. Of Adolf Hitler, Barkashov, the leader of the organization, declared: "I consider him a great hero of the German nation and of all white races. He succeeded in inspiring the whole nation to fight against the degradation and brainwashing of national values. "Until it was banned in 1999 and disbanded at the end of 2000, the group is estimated to have had approximately 20,000 to 25,000 members. Aleksandr Barkashov, along with other members of Russian National Unity, has been involved in religious and pro-Russian activities in the Russo-Ukrainian war.
Serbia.
The neo-fascist organization in Serbia was Obraz, which was banned by the Constitutional Court of Serbia on June 12, 2012.
Before that, on June 18, 1990, Vojislav Šeselj organized the Serbian Chetnik Movement (SČP), which was not allowed official registration because it was clearly Chetnik; on February 23, 1991, it merged with the National Radical Party (NRS), with Šeselj as leader, The Serbian Radical Party (SRS) was established with Tomislav Nikolić as its deputy leader. It was a Chetnik party oriented toward neo-fascism, aiming at territorial expansion of Serbia.
Slovakia
Kotleba-Slovak People's Party is a far-right party with views considered extremist and fascist. The party's leader, Marian Kotleba, is a former neo-Nazi who once wore a uniform that was modeled after the "Hlinka Guard," the Nazi-backed Slovak state militia of 1939-45. It opposes the Romani people, immigrants, the Slovak national uprising, NATO, the United States, and the European Union. The party also supports clerical fascist war criminal and former Slovak president Josef Tiso.
In 2003 Kotleva founded the far-right Slovak Community (Slovak: Slovenská Pospolitosť) party, and in 2007 the Slovak Interior Ministry banned the party from running and campaigning in elections. Despite this ban, Kotleba's party won 8.04% of the vote in the 2016 Slovak parliamentary elections; as of December 2022, its voter support had dropped significantly to about 3.1%.
Turkey.
Grey Wolves is an ultra-nationalist and neo-fascist youth organization in Turkey. It is the "unofficial armed wing" of the Nationalist Movement Party. Gray Wolves has been accused of terrorism. According to Turkish authorities, the organization committed 694 murders between 1974 and 1980 during the political violence of the late 1970s in Turkey.
The nationalist party MHP, founded by Alparslan Turkeş, is also sometimes described as neo-fascist.
United Kingdom
The British National Party (BNP) is a British nationalist party that espouses fascist and anti-immigrant ideology; it won two MEPs in the 2009 European elections, including former party leader Nick Griffin. Other British organizations that have been described as fascist or neo-fascist include the National Front, Combat 18, the English Defence League, and Britain First.
United States
United States.
Groups considered neo-fascist in the United States generally include neo-Nazi organizations and movements such as the Proud Boys, the National Alliance, and the American Nazi Party. The Institute for Historical Review publishes denialist historical papers, which are often anti-Semitic in nature. Alt-Right is a coalition of loosely connected individuals and organizations that advocate a wide range of far-right ideas, from neoreactionaries to white nationalists, but because Alt-Right individuals and organizations advocate radical forms of authoritarian ultra-nationalism, they are often included in the umbrella term.
Brazil.
The Jair Bolsonaro regime in Brazil has been cited as the rising point of neo-fascism in South America in the 21st century. It is based on authoritarian measures that pull rights away from the people, linked to the denial of science, belligerent rhetoric, and strong neoliberal economic policies. A combination of factors, including the backlash against the Workers' Party, fear and reaction to the 2013 uprising, and the economic crises of 2008 and 2014, have made Jair Bolsonaro a viable option. Thus, the multiple groups and different wings (military, ideological, religious, capital, etc.) that make up Bolsonarism represent realistic disagreements, strategies, objectives, and clear methods. This core of Brazilian neo-fascism converged its interests and rhetoric with Pentecostal religious fundamentalism, and both aligned themselves with the military sector and liberal think tanks. As a result, there is a power bloc within Bolsonarism consisting of non-fascist conservatives and far-right neo-fascists.
Bolivia.
Founded in 1937, the Bolivian Socialist Falange Party played an important role in mid-century Bolivian politics. The Luis Garcia Mesa Tejada regime, with the support of Italian neo-fascists Stefano Delle Chiaue, Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie, and the Buenos Aires regime, came to power in the Bolivian cocaine coup of 1980. That regime has been accused of neo-fascist tendencies and admiration for Nazi tools and rituals. Hugo Banzer Suarez, who preceded Tejada, also displayed an admiration for Nazism and fascism.
Oceania
Australia and New Zealand
Brenton Harrison Tarrant, the Australian perpetrator of the Christchurch Mosque shooting at the Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Center in Christchurch, New Zealand, was a fascist who espoused eco-fascism and was a member of the British He was an admirer of Oswald Mosley, leader of the fascist organization British Union of Fascists (BUF).
Africa
South Africa.
The Economic Freedom Fighters is a self-described pan-Africanist political party founded in 2013 by exiled former African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) chairman Julius Malema and his allies. Malema and his party have often been controversial for their involvement in anti-white and anti-Indian racism; in November 2019, Vishwas Satgar, a professor of international relations at the University of the Witwatersrand, defined them as a manifestation of a new phenomenon called "black neofascism."
Asia
India.
The Hindutva ideology of organizations such as the RSS has long been compared to fascism and Nazism. For example, an editorial in the National Herald, the organ of the Indian National Congress Party, on February 4, 1948, stated that "it seems to embody Hinduism in Nazi form" and recommended that it be ended. Similarly, in 1956, another Congressional leader compared the Jana Sangh to the German Nazis. since the 1940s and 1950s, many scholars have likened or compared Hindutva to fascism. Marzia Casolari has argued that the early Hindutva ideologues, "the Hindutva ideologues of the early leaders borrowed from pre-World War II European nationalist thought and its connection to the According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics and International Relations, the term Hindutva has "fascist overtones." Many scholars have noted that early Hindutva ideologues were inspired by the Italian and German fascist movements of the early 20th century.
Indian Marxist economist and political commentator Prabhat Patnaik calls the Hindutva "almost fascist in the classical sense." He states that the Hindutva movement is based on "class support, methods, and programs." According to Patnaik, the Hindutva has the following fascist elements: attempts to create a unified, homogeneous majority under the concept of "Hindus," dissatisfaction with past injustices, a sense of cultural superiority, interpretation of history according to this dissatisfaction and superiority, opposition to this interpretation rejection of rational debate; appeal to a majority based on race and masculinity".
Japan
After World War II, neo-fascism and ultra-nationalism were excluded from mainstream politics in Germany, but were partially associated with mainstream right-wing conservative politics in Japan; since 2006, all prime ministers of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party have been members of the far-right ultra-nationalist Japan Council.
Mongolia.
In Mongolia, located between the great powers Russia and China, ethnic unrest has driven many Mongolians to neo-fascism, an expression of nationalism centered on Genghis Khan and Adolf Hitler. Groups advocating such ideology include Blue Mongolia, Dayar Mongolia, and the Mongolian National Alliance.
Pakistan.
Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan is considered fascist by some analysts because of its involvement in Islamic extremism.
Taiwan.
The National Socialist Association (NSA) is a neo-fascist political organization founded in Taiwan in September 2006; the NSA considers Adolf Hitler its leader and often uses the slogan "Long Live Hitler." For this reason, it has been condemned by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an international Jewish human rights center.
Indonesia.
Adolf Hitler's propaganda advocating "Greater German" hegemony influenced similar ideas of "Indonesia Mulia" (Respectable Indonesia) and "Indonesia Raya" (Great Indonesia) in the former Dutch territory of Indonesia. The first fascist party was the Partai Fasis Indonesia (PFI). Sukarno admired Hitler's Nazi Germany and its vision of universal happiness. He said in 1963, "It is in the Third Reich that Germans think Germany will rise to the top of the rest of the nations of this world." He said Hitler was "exceptionally skillful" in "portraying his ideals." He spoke of Hitler's rhetorical skill, but denied any association with Nazism as an ideology, saying Indonesian nationalism was not as narrow as Nazi nationalism.
