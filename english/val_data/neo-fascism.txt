Neo-fascism is a post-World War II far-right ideology that includes significant elements of fascism. Neo-fascists typically advocate for ultranationalism, racial supremacy, populism, authoritarianism, nativism, xenophobia, and anti-immigration sentiment. They also often oppose liberal democracy, social democracy, parliamentarianism, liberalism, Marxism, capitalism, communism, and socialism.
Neo-fascism emerged in Europe in the decades following the defeat of fascism in World War II. It was influenced by the failure of fascism, the rise of the Cold War, and the perceived decline of Western civilization. Neo-fascist movements have been active in many countries around the world, including Italy, Germany, France, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
Neo-fascists have been responsible for a number of violent attacks and acts of terrorism. They have also been involved in the spread of hate speech and propaganda. Neo-fascism is a serious threat to democracy and human rights.
Here are some of the key characteristics of neo-fascism:
* Ultranationalism: Neo-fascists believe in the superiority of their own nation or race. They often glorify the past and advocate for a return to a mythical golden age.
* Racial supremacy: Neo-fascists believe that some races are superior to others. They often promote racist and discriminatory policies.
* Populism: Neo-fascists appeal to the common people, often by blaming immigrants, minorities, or other groups for the country's problems.
* Authoritarianism: Neo-fascists believe in strong, centralized government. They often support the suppression of dissent and the use of violence to achieve their goals.
* Nativism: Neo-fascists believe that their country should be for native-born citizens only. They often oppose immigration and multiculturalism.
* Xenophobia: Neo-fascists are hostile towards foreigners. They often promote anti-immigrant sentiment and policies.
* Anti-immigration sentiment: Neo-fascists oppose immigration. They often believe that immigrants are a threat to their country's culture and way of life.
