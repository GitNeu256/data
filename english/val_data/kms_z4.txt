The German destroyer Z4 Richard Baizen was one of four Type 1934 destroyers built for the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) in the mid-1930s.Completed in 1937, she spent most of her time in training, but in early 1939 she participated in the occupation of Memel When World War II began in September 1939, she was initially deployed to blockade the Polish coast, but was soon moved to the Kattegat Strait, where she inspected neutral ships for contraband; in late 1939 and early 1940, she laid two offensive minefields off the British coast; and in 1941 she was assigned to the Battle of the Sea, where she was responsible for the loss of 17 merchant ships, Z4 Richard Beitzen became a reserve ship for the Norwegian campaign in early 1940 and was transferred to France later that year.
She returned to Germany for refit in early 1941 and was transferred to Norway in June as part of preparations for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. z4 richard bietzen conducted anti-ship patrols in Soviet waters at the beginning of the campaign, but they were generally fruitless. Later that year, she escorted a number of German convoys in the Arctic; in early 1942, she was temporarily transferred to France in preparation for the Channel dash, as one of two battleships and one heavy cruiser escort, from Brest, France, through the English Channel to Germany and then back to Norway. z4 Richard Beitzen escorted several heavy cruisers at the beginning and end of the 1942 anti-ship raids; on December 31, 1942, Convoy JW 51B was attacked near the North Cape in Norway and took part in the Battle of the Barents Sea.
Z4 Richard Beitzen spent most of 1943 escorting ships to and from Norway until she ran aground in November. Severely damaged, repairs continued until she returned to Norway the following August and returned to her original duties; she ran aground again in October 1944 and was under repair until February 1945; while escorting a convoy in April, she was heavily damaged by aircraft and was still under repair when the war ended on May 9; Z4 Richard Beitzen was ultimately assigned to the British when the surviving German warships were divided among the Allies after the war; the British did not use her until she was scrapped in 1949.
Design and Description
Design work on the Type 34 destroyer began in 1932, around the time Weimar Germany abandoned the arms restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I. The original design envisioned a larger ship, more powerful than the French and Polish destroyers in service at the time, but the design was expanded as the German Navy expected her to serve as a small cruiser. The design work was rushed and apparently not well thought out, as the short foremast and lack of flare in the bow compromised the ship's seaworthiness and stability was inadequate. The only innovation in the design, the high-pressure water tube boiler, was an overly complex system that was rarely tested on board before being installed in the Type 34 and frequently failed throughout the life of the ship.
The ship was 119 meters long with a draft line length of 114 meters. The beam was 11.30 meters (37 feet 1 inch) and the maximum draft was 4.23 meters (13 feet 11 inches). Two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, used steam supplied by six Wagner boilers to produce 70,000 PS (51, 000 kW; 69,000 shp). The design speed was 36 knots (36 mph). The design speed was 36 knots (67 km/h; 41 mph), but maximum speed was 38.7 knots (71.7 km/h; 44.5 mph). The Type 34 was designed to carry up to 752 tons (740 tons) of fuel oil and have a range of 4,400 nautical miles (8,100 km, 5,100 miles) at a speed of 19 knots (35 km/h, 22 mph), but she proved to be top heavy when commissioned and 30% of her fuel was ballasted low in the ship The ship was found to be top-heavy and 30% of her fuel had to be held as ballast low in the ship. Effective range was found to be only 1,530 nautical miles (2,830 km; 1,760 miles) at 19 knots, and the Type 34 class crew consisted of 10 officers and 315 petty officers, with an additional 4 officers and 19 petty officers when serving as fleet flagships.
The Type 34 class carried five 12.7cm SK C/34 guns mounted on single gun mounts with gun shields, two forward and two aft, stacked on top of each other; the fifth gun was mounted on top of the aft superstructure. The guns were numbered from one to five from front to rear. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C/30 guns mounted on a pair of double gun mounts next to the rear funnel, and six 2 cm C/30 guns mounted on a single gun mount. Two 53.3 cm torpedo tubes were mounted. Each rack was equipped with a pair of loaded torpedoes.Z4 Richard Beitzen carried four deep-water launchers on the sides of the aft deck, six deep-water racks on the sides of the aft deck, and 32 or 64 deep-water detonators. Aft deck could be fitted with mine rails for up to 60 mines; a passive hydrophone system called "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) was fitted to detect submarines.
Modifications
The active sonar system was to be installed in June 1940, but it is not known when. During the war, the light anti-aircraft armament was augmented several times. An improved 2 cm C/38 gun replaced the original C/30 gun, and three more guns were added sometime in 1941. The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced by a 2 cm quadruple anti-aircraft gun, probably during a refit at the end of 1941; Z4 Richard Beitzen does not appear to have added any AA guns after this time.
Construction and Biography
Z4 Richard Beitzen was named after Lieutenant Richard Beitzen (Kapitänleutnant), a German naval officer who commanded the 14th Torpedo Boat Flotilla in World War I and was killed in March 1918. The ship was ordered on July 7, 1934 and broken ground on January 7, 1935 at Deutsche Werke in Kiel as yard number K245; she was launched on November 30 and completed on May 13, 1937. Upon completion, Z4 Richard Beitzen, together with her sister ships Z2 Georg Thiele and Z3 Max Schultz, called at Ulvik, Norway, in April 1938. After returning to port, she was taken over by the German company Werke and her bow was modified to reduce the amount of water coming over the bow in headwinds. This increased her overall length by 0.3 meters. She participated in the fleet review and subsequent fleet exercises in August, and was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 1 on October 26, and in December sailed with Z4 Richard Beitzen and her sisters Z1 Leberecht Maas, Z2 Georg Thiele, and Z3 Max Schultz off the coast of Iceland to evaluate her seaworthiness in the North Atlantic winter with her new bow. On March 23-24, 1939, she was one of the destroyers escorting Adolf Hitler aboard the pocket battleship Deutschland to occupy Memel. The following month she participated in fleet exercises in the Western Mediterranean and made several visits to Spanish and Moroccan ports in April and May. Upon returning to port, Z4 Richard Beitzen was involved in a stern collision with the destroyer F9. When World War II began in September 1939, Z4 Richard Beitzen was initially deployed to the Western Baltic to enforce the Polish blockade, but after one turbine failed to operate, she was immediately transferred to the Kattegat Strait in mid-September to inspect neutral ships for contraband. December On the night of the 12th and 13th, German destroyers sailed to lay minefields off the British coast. Under the command of Admiral Friedrich Bonte of the flagship Z19 Hermann Künne, Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z8 Bruno Heinemann, Z14 Friedrich Ihn, and Z15 Erich Steinbrinck laid 240 mines off the mouth of the Tyne River when the navigation lights were still on. The British were unaware of the minefield and lost 11 ships with a gross tonnage of 18,979 tons. On the way home, the destroyers were torpedoed by the submarine HMS Salmon, which was covering the destroyers' retreat, and ordered to escort the damaged light cruisers Leipzig and Nuremberg. Despite their escort, the submarine HMS Ursula managed to sneak inside the anti-submarine screen and fired a salvo of six torpedoes at Leipzig at the mouth of the Elbe River the next day. Two of the torpedoes hit the F9, which sank three minutes later, causing many casualties, but the others missed.
Bonte, along with Z14 Friedrich Ihn, Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, Z22 Anton Schmitt, Z4 Richard Beitzen, and Z20 Karl Galster, was destroyed during the night of January 10 and 11. Ihn had boiler problems which reduced her top speed to 27 knots (50 km/h, 31 mph) and she was escorted back to Germany by Z4 Richard Beitzen. Only one 251-ton fishing boat was damaged in the minefield.Z3 Max Schultz, Z4 Richard Beitzen, and Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt laid 110 magnetic mines in the Shipwash waters off Harwich on February 9-10, 1940. They laid 110 magnetic mines, sinking six ships of the 28,496 GRT and damaging another.
Operation Wikinger.
On February 22, 1940, Z4 Richard Beitzen and destroyers Z3 Max Schulze, Z1 Leberecht Maas, Z6 Theodor Riedel, Z13 Erich Kellner, and Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt sailed to the Dogger Bank to intercept British fishing boats in Operation Wikinger They sailed to the Dogger Bank to intercept British fishing boats in Operation Wikinger. En route, the convoy was mistakenly attacked by Heinkel He111 bombers of Bomber Command 26 (Kampfgeschwader 26); Z1 Leberecht Maass was hit by at least one bomb, lost steering, split in half, and sank with the loss of 280 crew members. During the rescue operation, Z3 Max Schulze struck a mine and sank with the loss of all 308 crew members. Hitler ordered the convening of a commission of inquiry to determine the cause, which concluded that both ships were sunk by He 111 bombs. The German Navy did not inform the destroyers that the Luftwaffe was conducting anti-ship patrols at the time, nor did they inform the Luftwaffe that the destroyers were at sea. Postwar investigations revealed that one or two ships had struck British mines laid by the destroyers Ivanhoe and Intrepid.
German Invasion of Norway
Z4 Richard Beitzen stood by as a reserve ship for the German invasion of Norway on April 9, Operation Weserbung. Two days later, she escorted the light cruiser Cologne to Wilhelmshaven; from 28 April to 20 May, she helped lay minefields in the Kattegat strait, then entered a refit that lasted until September; in October, she was transferred to Brest, France; on the nights of 24 and 25 November, Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z10 Hans Lody and Z20 Karl Galster departed Brest for Land's End waters. En route, they encountered several fishing boats southwest of Wolf Rock and engaged them with gunfire to little effect. The German ships then sighted a small convoy, sinking one of the three merchant ships and damaging the other. The flash of a cannon alerted the five destroyers of the British Fifth Destroyer Flotilla, but they were unable to intercept the German destroyers before dawn.Three nights later, the German ships again sailed into the same waters. They encountered two tugboats and one barge, but only sank the former one and a total of 424 GRT barges. The 5th Destroyer Squadron was able to intercept the barge at about 06:30 on November 29. The Germans opened fire first, each destroyer firing four torpedoes, of which only two from Z10 Hans Rodi hit the target, HMS Javelin. The torpedoes hit both ends of the ship, blowing off the bow and stern, but the British were able to tow the ship home.
In January 1941, a minefield was laid off the southeastern coast of England. The following month, she escorted the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper out of Brest and back to port; Z4 Richard Beitzen temporarily sailed for Kiel on March 16 to begin a refit. She was then sent to Kirkenes, Norway, in July 1941. As part of the 6th Destroyer Squadron (6. Zerstörer-Flottille), she participated in a sortie on July 12-13, sinking two small Soviet ships; in another sortie on July 22, Z4 Richard Beitzen sank a Soviet flying boat on the water; on August 9, she went out again, sinking a German When she sank a converted fishing trawler (the Touman), she was damaged by the impact of a near miss from a shore gun and sailed for Germany for repairs five days later.
In mid-January 1942, the battleship Tirpitz escorted the battleship Tirpitz for several days as she sailed from the Baltic Sea to Trondheim, Norway; Z4 Richard Beitzen, along with the remnants of the 5th Zellsteller fleet, left Kiel on January 24 for France as part of preparations for the dash across the Channel.1 On the night of January 25, Z8 Bruno Heinemann struck two mines laid by HMS Plover off Belgium and sank; Z4 Richard Beitzen rescued 200 survivors and headed for Le Havre, landing them before reaching Brest on the 26th. The German ship left Brest on February 11, surprising the British. Z4 Richard Beitzen helped repel an attack by five British destroyers and was shot down by a newly equipped 2cm anti-aircraft gun after a near miss from a Bristol Blenheim bomber. Shortly thereafter, the ship, along with four other destroyers, escorted Prinz Eugen and the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer to Trondheim. Due to bad weather, Z4 Richard Beitzen and two other destroyers were forced to return to port before reaching Trondheim, where Prinz Eugen was heavily damaged by British submarines after separation. After returning to port, the ship required a mechanical overhaul and began a refit in Bremen on March 14. After the refit was completed, she was assigned to escort the heavy cruiser Lützow to Bogen Bay, Norway, laying a minefield at Skagerrak en route.
Convoy Interception.
Z4 Richard Beitzen took part in the outpost of Operation Rösselsprung, an attempt to intercept the Arctic convoy PQ 17 in July. Admirals Scheer and Lützow formed one group, while Tirpitz and Hipper formed another. On the way to the rendezvous at Alta Fjord, Lützow and three destroyers ran aground, forcing the entire group to abandon the operation. z4 Richard Beitzen escorted two oil tankers to Alta Fjord on July 2-3. during the August Wunderland operation, z4 Richard Beitzen, Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, and Z15 Erich Steinbrinck escorted Admiral Schee at the beginning and end of the Soviet ship attack operations in the Kara Sea. They also escorted the minesweeper Ulm, which departed in mid-August to lay a minefield off Cape Zelania; from 13 to 15 October, Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, and destroyers Z27 and Z30 laid a minefield off the Kanin Peninsula in the White Sea estuary; and from 14 to 15 October, Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt and destroyers Z27 and Z30 escorted Admiral Shahi to the White Sea estuary, They sank the Soviet icebreaker Mikoyan. Three weeks later, the same four destroyers escorted Admiral Hipper as he attempted to intercept an Allied merchant ship heading alone to a Soviet port in early November.
In late December, in Operation Regenbogen, an attempt to intercept Convoy JW51B from England bound for the Soviet Union, Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, and destroyer Z29 attempt to divert the convoy while Lützow and three other destroyers attack The three destroyers escorted the Admiral Hipper away from the Admiral Hipper and searched the convoy, which they found on the morning of December 31. Destroyer HMS Obdurate in turn spotted them and approached to investigate when the German ships opened fire at a distance of 8,000 meters (8,700 yards); Obdurate turned to rejoin the convoy without damage and the German ships were ordered to rejoin Hipper and therefore did not pursue. The Germans found the minesweeper HMS Bramble, which had earlier detached from the convoy to search for the stragglers, and ordered the destroyer to sink it in order to approach the convoy, and Hipper engaged the convoy escort. In poor visibility, this took some time, during which time Hipper was surprised by the British light cruiser Sheffield and the Jamaica's covering force. After the sinking of Bramble, the German destroyer attempted to rejoin Hipper, but was unaware that the British cruisers were in the area. When they found each other at a distance of 4,000 meters (4,400 yards), they confused Sheffield with Hipper and were surprised when Sheffield opened fire with all guns on Z16 Friedrich Eckold, losing everyone and sinking her. z4 Richard Beitzen did not engage until she ran into darkness. The Z4 Richard Beitzen did not engage until they fled into the darkness.
In January 1943, Lieutenant Colonel Hans Dominik took command and escorted the damaged Admiral Hipper and Cologne, arriving at Christiansan at the end of the month. She began escorting convoys between that port and Aarhus, Denmark, and in early March escorted the battleship Scharnhorst to Alta Fjord. The following month, she escorted Nuremberg back to the Baltic Sea and began a refit at Svinemünde that lasted until October. Returning to the Arctic, Z4 Richard Beitzen ran aground in Karmsund on October 27 and sustained extensive damage; Z4 Richard Beitzen was refloated on November 5 and towed to Haugesund for emergency repairs; she arrived in Bergen on November 26 and underwent temporary repairs until December 18, when she was taken to Stettin for repairs. The ship arrived at Stettin five days later, but due to congestion in the drydock, repairs, including the fitting of a new bow, did not begin until January 17. Repairs were completed in June, but mechanical problems prevented her from being operational again until August 5, when she arrived in Horten, Norway.
Z4 Richard Beitzen resumed escort duties and laid mines at Skagerrak until she ran aground again in November. Repairs were slow and she was not fully operational until February 15, 1945; on the morning of April 24, she was wrecked by a radar-equipped bomber while monitoring a convoy; she entered Oslo, Norway, for repairs, which were not completed before the war ended. z4 richard bazen was captured on may 14 Captured by the British and temporarily turned over to the Norwegian Navy on July 15; turned over to the British at the end of 1945 and towed to Rosyth in February 1946; Z4 Richard Bezuyen was ordered to be used as a target in September, but three months later developed a serious leak, so she was not sunk It was beached. Temporary repairs were made and she was scrapped in January 1947. The following year, she was assigned to C.W. Dorkin for dismantling and towed to the Gateshead facility on January 10, 1949.
