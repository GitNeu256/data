The Type 1934 destroyers, also known as the Z1 class or Leberecht Maass class after the lead ship, were a group of four destroyers built for the German Navy (initially called the Reichsmarine and then renamed the Kriegsmarine in 1935) during the mid-1930s, shortly before the beginning of World War II.
The Type 1934-class destroyers were propelled by a pair of Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving a single three-bladed, 3.25-meter (10 ft 8 in) propeller, using superheated steam provided by six Wagner water-tube boilers that operated at a pressure of 70 atm (1,029 psi; 7,093 kPa) and a temperature of 450 °C (842 °F). The ships had a top speed of 36 knots (67 km/h; 41 mph).
The ships were armed with five 127 mm (5 in) guns in single mounts, two forward and three aft. They also carried two quadruple mounts for 533 mm (21 in) torpedo tubes, one on each beam. The ships had a crew of 240 officers and men.
The Type 1934-class destroyers were the first major warships built by Germany after the First World War. They were designed to meet the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles, which limited the size and armament of the German Navy. The ships were well-armed and fast, and they were a significant improvement over the older destroyers of the Reichsmarine.
The Type 1934-class destroyers saw extensive service during World War II. They were involved in a number of major battles, including the Battle of the Denmark Strait, the Battle of the Barents Sea, and the Battle of the North Cape. The ships also conducted numerous anti-submarine and convoy escort missions.
Of the four ships in the class, two were sunk during the war. The Z1 Leberecht Maass was sunk in the Battle of the Denmark Strait in May 1941. The Z3 Max Schultz was sunk by a British submarine in December 1942. The other two ships, the Z2 Georg Thiele and the Z4 Richard Beitzen, survived the war and were scrapped in the 1950s.
The Type 1934-class destroyers were a significant addition to the German Navy. They were well-armed and fast, and they played an important role in the early years of World War II.
