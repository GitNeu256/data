After the creation of the Leopard 1 tank in 1965, Porsche began work in Germany to improve its design, in parallel with the continuation of the joint project of the USA and Germany MBT-70. The national German program, which received the name "Gilded Leopard" in 1967, and then — "Boar" led to the creation in 1969 of two prototypes intended for testing. Since 1970, prototypes have been produced by Krauss-Maffei. In 1973, the promising tank received its modern name. Several Leopard-2 prototypes participated in comparative tests with the promising American XM-1 tank at the Aberdeen proving ground, during which the German tank was equal in many respects, superior in maintainability and power reserve, but inferior in accuracy and accuracy of fire.
Leopard 2 is one of the most well-known and powerful tank systems in the world. Developed in Germany, it was first introduced in 1979 and has since become a symbol of reliability and strength. Leopard 2 is a continuation of the Leopard tank series, which began with the Leopard 1 in 1965.
The main advantage of Leopard 2 is its armor. It features a powerful composite armor that provides a high degree of protection against anti-tank weapons and machine guns. The Leopard 2's armor is capable of withstanding hits from projectiles up to 120mm in caliber. Additionally, the tank is equipped with an active protection system that can intercept and destroy enemy projectiles in flight.
Another important feature of Leopard 2 is its firepower. It is equipped with a smoothbore gun with a caliber of 120mm, capable of engaging targets at distances of up to 4 kilometers. The tank also has machine guns and anti-tank missiles in its arsenal, making it a versatile combat vehicle.
Leopard 2 also possesses high maneuverability. It is equipped with a powerful engine that allows it to reach speeds of up to 70 kilometers per hour on roads and up to 45 kilometers per hour off-road. The tank has excellent cross-country capabilities and can overcome various obstacles, including water barriers and rough terrain.
Overall, Leopard 2 is one of the most modern and effective tanks in the world. It is successfully operated in many countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey, and others. Leopard 2 continues to evolve and undergo upgrades to remain at the forefront of armored warfare.
Serial production
Based on the results of all tests and design improvements in 1977, it was decided to produce 1800 tanks in five series for the needs of the Bundeswehr; Krauss-Maffei remained the main contractor. In 1979, it entered service.
Modifications
Leopard 2 tanks are created according to the classical layout: the driver is in the front of the hull, the tank commander, the gunner (to the right of the gun) and the loader (to the left) are in the turret; the engine is located in the aft part. The armament of all tanks, with the exception of the A6 model, consists of a 120 mm Rheinmetall smoothbore gun with a 44-caliber barrel length, two 7.62 mm machine guns - paired with a cannon and an anti—aircraft gun located on the roof of the tower. In addition, there were mortar blocks on the tower, designed to set up a smoke screen. Armor protection and fire control systems were constantly upgraded on tanks.
The combat weight of the first series of vehicles was over 50 tons, they already had combined multilayer armor, a gun stabilized in two planes, night vision devices (in the project, however, thermal imagers were not delivered on time, they were installed on tanks already in service. The tanks that received thermal imagers were assigned the designation 2A2). The ammunition included armor-piercing feathered sub-caliber shells and high-explosive cumulative shells designed to defeat a wide range of targets. 15 of the 42 shots were stored in the laying of the first stage, in the aft niche of the tower under the firing panel; the rest were to the left of the driver without any protection.
Tanks of the second and third series, produced in 1982 - 1984, received the designation A1. Among the changes was the improvement of the commander's observation devices, the gunner's sight, the change in the location of ammunition, fuel in order to increase safety, etc. The tanks of the fourth series, produced in 1984 - 1985, received the designation A3 and such improvements as: a new radio station, additional protection of ammunition, etc. In 1985 - 1987 . the fifth series of machines was produced, which received the most serious improvements made at that time: a sharp increase in the armor protection of the tower, additional measures to increase the survival of the crew, the introduction of an improved ballistic computer in the ACS, the introduction of high-power projectiles into the ammunition. The weight of the Leopard 2A4 has increased to 55 tons.
Until 1992, three additional batches of tanks were built, generally similar to the machines of the fifth series, and received the same designation.
During the production of the last three series, it was decided to start work on modernization projects for these tanks due to the appearance of new formidable tanks in the Soviet Army, such as the T-80B. Based on the experimental Komponentenversuchsträger machine, several projects were proposed in 1991, one of which was given a move under the designation KWS II; starting in 1995, the modernization of 6 - 8 series tanks to the Leopard 2A5 level began. These cars received a new driver's hatch, which provided a better overview and a reduction in the weakened area of the hull. The turret was significantly upgraded: the cannon mask was completely redesigned, the forehead and sides were covered with modules of spaced (presumably having non-energetic reactive properties) armor. The electrohydraulic gun stabilization system was replaced with a less fire—hazardous, fully electric one; the gunner received an upgraded sight, and the commander received an independent 2nd generation thermal imager built into a panoramic observation device; the characteristics of the weapon stabilizer improved. The tank received a GPS navigation system.
All these measures led to an increase in weight to 59.5 - 62 tons, depending on the armor set. Finally, some of the 2A5 tanks (225 units) have been upgraded since 2001 to the level of the most modern German MBT, the Leopard 2A6 level. The new tank received an enhanced turret reservation and additional mine protection. The main difference of the new model is the Rhl 120/L55 gun with an increased barrel length of 11 calibers (1320 mm). Together with the barrel, the muzzle energy and the initial velocity of the projectiles increased, and, as a result, their armor penetration and range of destruction. No less important is the fact of installing a tank information and control system. The weight of the tank has increased to 62 tons.
In 2010, at the Eurosatory exhibition, the German company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) demonstrated a new, seventh modification of the Leopard 2 tank, called Leopard 2A7 +.
The new modification of the tank is a modular update package, with the possibility of optimization for the specific requirements of its customers. Innovations of Leopard 2A7+ compared to Leopard 2A6:
* dramatically improved mine protection;
* overhead elements that cover the entire turret, the frontal part of the hull and two-thirds of the side to protect against cumulative melee weapons (such as RPG-7), mines, homemade land mines, damaging elements of cluster munitions, BOPS, anti-tank missiles with optoelectronic, infrared and laser guidance systems *;
* implementation of the "digital tower" technology;
* improvement of the characteristics of the SLA to ensure the possibility of hitting the target with the first shot, especially in motion;
* the introduction of a "commander's" brake into the tank design allows the tank commander to stop the tank at any time;
* adding modern shells to the tank's ammunition;
* equipping with a stabilized remotely controlled combat module of auxiliary weapons;
* a communication system that allows the crew to exchange information with *interacting infantry units;
* the introduction of an auxiliary power plant into the tank design, which supplies numerous electronic systems with electricity without the need to turn on the main engine: this not only saves engine life, but also reduces the thermal and acoustic visibility of the machine;
* installation of equipment designed to include each main battle tank in a single automated logistics system: this greatly simplifies and accelerates the process of providing tank units with ammunition, fuel and other logistical assets.
In terms of combat weight, the Leopard 2A7+ tank significantly exceeds the previous modification, its mass can reach 70 tons.
