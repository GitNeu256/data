The Leopard 2 is the 3rd generation German main battle tank (MBT). Developed by Krauss-Maffei in the 1970s, the tank was commissioned in 1979 and replaced the previous Leopard 1 as a main battle tank for the West German Army. The various iterations of Leopard 2 continue to be operated not only by the German army, but also by 13 other European countries, and several non-European countries, including Canada, Chile, Indonesia and Singapore. Some business countries have licensed Leopard 2 designs for local production and domestic development.
Leopard 2 has 2 main development tranches. The first tanks were produced up to the Leopard 2A4 standard and feature vertical turret armor. Leopard 2a5 and later, the 2nd tranche, along with other improvements, features angled arrow-shaped turret applique armor. The main armament of all Leopard2 tanks is a rheinmetall 120mm smooth-cavity gun. This is operated by a digital fire control system, a laser rangefinder and an advanced night vision and sighting device. The tank is equipped with a V12 twin-turbo diesel engine manufactured by MTU Friedrichshafen.
In the 1990s, Leopard 2 was used by the German army in peacekeeping operations in Kosovo. In the 2000s, the Dutch, Danish and Canadian forces deployed Leopard 2 tanks to the war in Afghanistan as part of their contribution to the International Security Support Force. In the 2010s, Turkish Leopard 2 tanks were operating in Syria. In 2023, the Ukrainian Leopard 2 tank took action in the war between Russia and Ukraine.
History
Development.
Even if the Leopard 1 had just entered service, the West German army was interested in the production of improved tanks in the next 10 years. As a result, the development of the MBT-70 began in 1963 in cooperation with the United States. But already in 1967, it became doubtful whether the MBT-70 will enter service at any time in the near future. That is why the German government in 1967 issued an order to investigate the future upgrade options of the Leopard 1 to the German company Porsche.
The study was named vergoldeter Leopard (Gilded Leopard) and focused on incorporating advanced technology into Leopard's design. The planned upgrade included the addition of an autoloader, a coaxial autocannon and an independent Commander's periscope. Anti-aircraft machine guns could be operated from inside the car, and television surveillance cameras were mounted on an expandable mast. The shape of the turret and hull has been optimized using cast steel armor, and the suspension, transmission and engine exhaust ports have been improved.
Prototype development.
After the end of the study of the Gilded Leopard in 1967, the West German government decided to focus on experimental development in its feasibility study to improve the Leopard 1 and develop new components for use in future main battle tank programs. Initially, 2500 million DM was invested, but after reaching the conclusion that the development of 2 test beds is impossible with such a low budget, a total of 3000 to 3200 million DM was invested. Experimental development was entrusted to the company Krauss-Maffei, but it was obliged to work with Porsche for the development of the chassis, and with Wegmann for the development of the turret.
2 prototypes with different components were built with the aim of improving the Leopard 70 concept to match the firepower requirements of the Mbt-1. High initial hit probabilities in the range of 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) and the ability to accurately engage moving targets using a computerized fire control system were the main goals of the experimental development. The resulting vehicle was nicknamed Keeler ("Tasker"). The 2 prototypes of the Keylor (ET01 and ET02) were manufactured in 1969 and 1970, both with an MB872 engine.
The MBT-70 was a revolutionary design, but after significant cost overruns and technical problems, Germany withdrew from the project in 1969. After a failed attempt to save the MBT-70 by conceptual changes to eliminate the biggest problem — the driver sitting on the turret — it became clear that Germany would stop bilateral development in late 1969. The undersecretary of the Military Procurement Department of the German Ministry of Defense proposed to reuse as much of the technology developed for the MBT-70 as possible, which was called Eber ("boar"), since he was named Eberhardt. The Eber used a modified MBT-70 turret and hull, and the driver was sitting on the hull. Only wooden mockups were made.
After 1 year, instead of finishing the development of Eber, it was chosen to continue development based on the early Keeler project in the late 1960s. In 1971, the name of the design was decided as Leopard 2, the original Leopard retroactively became Leopard 1, and Paul-Werner Krapke became a project officer for the Leopard2 program. Originally 2 versions were projected: the Leopard 2k and Leopard 2FK armed with guns were armed with the XM70 gun/launcher weapon of the MBT-150.
In 1971, 17 prototypes were ordered, but production of the PT12 hull was discontinued and only 16 were manufactured. At first 10 people were ordered, then 7 people were ordered. The 17 turrets were designated from T1 to T17, and the hulls were designated from PT1 to PT11 and from PT13 to PT17. To test more components and concepts, each prototype was fitted with a component that no other prototype has. 10 of the turrets were equipped with a 105mm smooth-cavity gun, while the other 7 were equipped with a 120mm smooth-cavity gun.
The hulls PT11 and PT17 were fitted with hydraulic and pneumatic suspensions based on the MBT-70 design. These 2 hull running gear had only 6 road wheels. Various types of auxiliary power supply units (APUs) were installed in the prototype. With the exception of the turret mounted on the PT11, all turrets were equipped with machine guns for air defense, but were equipped with a 20mm remote-controlled auto cannon. With the exception of the hulls PT07, PT09, PT15, and PT17, all prototypes used the MB873 engine. The road wheel was taken from the MBT-70 and the return roller from the Leopard 1. The prototype was designed with the expected weight of mlc50, which is equivalent to approximately 47.5 tons (46.7 tons long and 52.4 tons short). The welded turrets utilized spaced armor formed of two steel plates. The prototype was equipped with an EMES-12 optical rangefinder and a fire control system, which was later adopted by the Leopard 1a4.
The new turret, designed by Wegman in mid-1973, was 1.5 tons (1.7 tons) lighter. It was called the Spitzmaus-Turm (Togary turret) because of its very inclined front. This design was only possible with the new EMES-1,720 optical rangefinder, which required a base length of only 68 millimeters (350 inches) rather than the previous 14 millimeters (13 inches). Based on experience in the Yom Kippur War, a higher level of protection was required than the heavily sloping and spaced armor of the prototype in late 1973, and the Spitzmouth Tulum was not produced.
The weight limit was raised from MLC50 to mlc60, which is equivalent to about 55 tons (54 tons long and 61 tons short). The T14 turret was modified to test the new armor configuration, resulting in a blocky appearance as a result of the use of vertical modules with spaced multi-layered armor. It was also used to test the new EMES-13 optical rangefinder. The modified T14 turret was designated t14mod. It was also equipped with a fully electric turret drive and stabilization system jointly developed by General Electric and AEG Telefunken.
American rating of Leopard2AV and XM1 Abrams
In 1973-7, German Federal Defense Minister Georg Leber and his US counterpart, James R. Schlesinger, agreed to a high degree of standardization of main battle tanks in favor of nato. By integrating components already fully developed by the German company for Leopard 2, it is possible to reduce the cost of the US prototype tank, XM70 Abrams, developed after the MBT-1. To assess the harmonization of components between XM1 and Leopard 2, a German commission was sent to the United States. However, American law did not allow public bidders to interfere with procurement tenders after a contract with the intent of profit and deadline was awarded to a private company.
As a result, modifications to the Leopard 2 prototype were investigated to meet the requirements of the US military. In 1974-12-11, a memorandum of understanding (mou) was signed between Germany and the United States, and in 1973, after the United States purchased and investigated a prototype of PT07, it declared that the United States would test an improved version of Leopard 2 compared to the XM1 prototype. The Memorandum obliges the Federal Republic of Germany to send a complete prototype, hull, vehicle and some special ballistic components for ballistic testing to the United States, passing the US test procedure at no additional cost.
The Leopard2AV (strict version) was based on the experience of previous Leopard2 development. It was created to meet the US requirements and the latest protection requirements of the German MoD. The T14mod turret was used as the base for the Leopard 2av's turret, but several attempts were required to meet the required level of protection of the hull, up to the final ballistic test in 1976-6-23-26. Following the preference of the US laser rangefinder, the turret of the prototype PT19 was fitted with a laser rangefinder developed together with the American company Fuse.
Compared to the previous Leopard2 prototype, the emes-12 optical rangefinder has been replaced, crosswind sensor, air pressure and temperature sensor, powder temperature sensor, PERI R12 Commander site with IR searchlight, short range grenade launcher for use against infantry, retractable searchlight, spotlight, retractable passive night vision The shooting control system has been simplified by removing the application site, APU and mechanical loading assistant.
The design and production of the Leopard 2av took longer than expected, leading to delays in shipping to the United States and US valuation. Before 1976/9/1 I could not test Leopard 2av. Even though Germany wanted the Leopard2AV and Xm1 prototypes to be evaluated simultaneously, the US military decided not to wait for the Leopard2AV and pre-tested the XM1 prototypes from Chrysler and General Motors.
These included the pt105mm rifle L7 gun and the PT20 with the fuse fire control system, the PT19 with the same fire control system, the PT21 interchangeable with the 120mm rheinmetall smooth bore gun, and the Krupp Atlas Elektronik EMES-13 fire control system and the PT21 with the 120mm rheinmetall gun. The Leopard 2av fully met the requirements of the United States. A study conducted by the American company FMC decided to shift the focus to the possibility of common parts between the two tanks, rather than the possibility of the US military adopting the Leopard 2av before the end of the test, in which it is possible to produce the Leopard 2av under license in the United States without exceeding the cost limit set by the US military. The Fmc decided not to submit a technical proposal after obtaining a license for the production of the Leopard 2av, as there are few opportunities for the US military to adopt vehicles that have not been developed in the United States.
US military assessments showed that the XM1 covered most of the surface of the tank with special armor than the Leopard 2av. The difference in armor protection was due to the difference in perception of the expected threat, as well as the haste that the Leopard 2av was designed to accommodate special armor. In the mobility trial, the Leopard2AV performed better than the xm1 prototype. The AGT-1500 turbine engine proved to consume about 50% more fuel, while the Diehl truck had higher durability, while the truck used in the XM1 prototype failed to meet military requirements. The thermal signature of the MTU diesel engine was much lower. The shooting control system and the sight of the Leopard 2 were considered better, and the 120mm gun proved to be better. The production cost of the XM1 tank was7728,000 (1976), while the Leopard 2av cost高56,000 higher.
After the American assessment of Leopard2AV and the US military's decision to choose XM1 Abrams, both American and German sources condemned the other side. According to the American literature, it was discovered that the Leopard 2av prototype used in the mobility test was low weight.
In Germany, the test conditions were criticized as unrealistic and in favor of XM1. Instead of using actual performance data, we used the calculated virtual acceleration. The XM1 had a similar internal layout to the Leopard2AV because the Xm1 prototype was manned by a professional crew, but the xm1 had a similar internal layout to the Leopard2AV because the leopard2AV had to be manned by conscripts to prove that the leopard2AV was not so complex. Nevertheless, it turned out to have a slightly higher firing speed. The firing on the move was demonstrated on a flat track, disabling the better stabilization system of the Leopard 2av.
Series production
The decision to produce the Leopard2 tank for the German army was made by adopting the leopard 2 model, which produced many Leopard1A4 tanks, or an improved version of the leopard105a4 with a 120mm smooth-cavity gun, improved armor protection, a new fire control system, and an 890kw (1,190 hp) or 1,100 kw (1,500 hp) engine. This was done after studies were conducted that showed that the combat potential of the German army was higher than that of the German army. Before the start of series production in 1979, various changes were applied to the design of the Leopard 2. The engine, transmission and suspension were slightly modified and improved. Improved ballistic protection of the turret and hull, eliminating weaknesses.
The turret, equipped with an ammunition depot and hydraulic system, was separated from the crew compartment and fitted with a blow-out panel. The development of several new components was introduced to Leopard2 after the development of the Leopard2AV and the completion of US testing. For the series version, a fuse-designed laser rangefinder made with a common module in the United States has been selected as a passive EMES-13 rangefinder. The EMES-13 system was considered an excellent solution, but the fuse system was cheaper and fully developed.
The German company Krupp-Atlas-Elektronik licensed the fuse design and modified it to meet the needs of the German army. The modified rangefinder received the designation of EMES-15. The installation of the US AGT-2 turbine engine on Leopard 1500 was tested by MaK. The AGT-1500 was made in the United States and required deep modifications to the chassis of the Leopard 2. However, running tests on the WTD41 revealed many shortcomings, including high fuel consumption and poor transmission performance, including brakes. Therefore, this project has ended.
In 1977/1, Germany ordered a small pre-series of 3 hulls and 2 turrets delivered in 1978. These vehicles had enhanced armor protection on the front of the hull. One of the hulls was equipped with a previous t1 turret, which was used for military testing at the German Army School in Munster until 1979. In 1977-9, 1800Leopard2 tanks were ordered and produced in 5 batches. The main contractor was Krauss-Maffei, but Maschinenbau Kiel (MaK) was awarded a contract to produce 45% of the tank. The first batch consisted of 380 tanks. In 1979 it was planned to deliver 6 cars, in 1980 it was planned to deliver 114 cars, in 1981 it was planned to deliver 180 cars, and in the following year it was planned to deliver 300 cars.
The first series production tank was delivered in 1979-10-25. By 1982, the first batch of all 380 Leopard 2 tanks had been completed. The 209 is the Krauss-Maffei (Chassis no.10001 to 10210), the 171 is connected to the MaK (chassis no.20001-20172). The first production tank was equipped with the PzB-200 image intensifier due to the lack of production of the new thermal night sight system, which was later renovated to the previous model. After the initial 5 batches, another 3 batches of Leopard2 tanks were ordered, increasing the number of Leopard2 tanks ordered by Germany to a total of 2125 units. The 6th batch was ordered in 1987/6 and consisted of tanks produced between 1988/1 and 1989/5 of 150 tanks. Between 1988-5 and 1990-4, the 100th batch of 7 cars was produced. The last batch of 75 German troops in total was produced from 1991-1 to 1992-3.
During the Cold War, 16 Leopard 2 tanks were produced a month. Although the vehicle's production rate slowed in the ensuing decades, KMW still retained the ability to return to such manufacturing levels if it needed to reproduce at a higher rate and the supply chain could supply enough material.
Further improvements
The previous model only changed in detail, but the Leopard 2a4 introduced a digital ballistic computer and an improved fire extinguishing system. Starting from the sixth batch, the tank was equipped with an improved armor array and a new side skirt. In 1984, the German military procurement agency stated some requirements for future Leopard 2 upgrades. In 1989, with the delivery of the first prototype, the Kampfwertsteigerung (Combat Potential Enhancement) program was launched in Germany. Official military requirements were published in 1990-3.
It was predicted that the KWS program would consist of 3 stages. At the first stage, we replaced the Rheinmetall 120mm L/44 barrel and the corresponding gun rack with a longer-barreled, more lethal L/55 version. This stage was adopted in the form of a 225Leopard2A6 tank, which began in 2001 and continued until 2005. Stage 2 focused on improving armor protection and survivability and was adopted from 1995 in the form of Leopard 2a5. The basic armor of the tank was replaced, and additional armor modules were attached to the turret. The first batch of 225Leopard2 tanks was upgraded to the Leopard 2A5 configuration between 1995 and 1998, and the 2nd batch of 125 followed between 1999 and 2002.
The third stage was the planned replacement of the Leopard 2 turret with a new turret equipped with a 140mm NPzK tank gun, an autoloader and an IFIS battlefield management system. The ship's ballistic protection was to be improved. A total of 650 Leopard 2 and KWS3 tanks were initially planned. No final decision was made, but the 140mm NPzK tank gun was tested on an old prototype. In 1995, it was decided to discontinue due to changes in the political environment. The funds were redirected to the German Army's Neue Gepanzerte Plattformen (new armored Platform) project. The Leopard2A6M was developed with a kit that provides enhanced protection against mines that can explode under the hull (such as mines with bending wire triggers) and explosively formed penetrator mines. The Leopard2A6M weighs 62.5 tons.
The latest version of the tank is Leopard 2A7, which began service in 2014 with the first batch of 20 tanks. Before the first Leopard 2a7 tank was handed over to the Germans, plans were made for an upgrade. At this point, a "widespread" increase in combat value was planned, while maintaining the original maneuverability of the Leopard 2. The optics of the tank will also be improved.
In 2015/4, Welt am Sonntag claimed that the tungsten (wolfram) round used in Leopard 2 could not penetrate the modernized version of the Russian T-90 or t-80. They also said that the German army will develop a new and improved round, but it will be developed exclusively for Leopard 2a7.
In 2015, Rheinmetall revealed that it was developing a new 130mm smooth-cavity gun for the Leopard 2 tank and its successor. This gun offers a 50% increase in performance and penetration. Marketing of the new gun was scheduled to begin in 2016.
Exchange
Leopard2 first began service in 1979, and its service life is expected to end around 2030. In 2015/5, the German Ministry of Defense announced plans to develop a tank in collaboration with France as a successor to both the Leopard 2 and Leclerc tanks. Technologies and concepts will be investigated to determine what capabilities will be needed for future tanks. Prior to the deployment of the new tank, titled Main Ground Combat System (MGCS), an incremental upgrade to Leopard 2 was made, with a new digital turret core system and situational awareness system.
The increase in short-term lethality is expected to come from a 120mm gun with higher pressure firing new ammunition, offering 55 percent better performance than the L/20. The medium-term effort will focus on the concept of a 50 mm Rheinmetall gun that increases armor penetration by 130%. The importance of direct firing weapons is increasing, since the Russian T-14Armata is equipped with Afghanit, an active protection system designed to mitigate the effectiveness of ATGM.
Design
Protection
The Leopard 2 uses multilayered armor spaced throughout the design. The armor is made of steel plate combination of different hardness, elastic material and other non-metallic materials. High hardness and high ductility steel plates are used. Armor is the result of extensive research about the mechanisms of formation and penetration of shaped charge jets. The armor of the Leopard 2 could be based on the British Burlington armor, which had already been demonstrated in West Germany in 1970.
Then, in the mid-1970s, the full details about Burlington were handed over to the West German government. The frontal arc of the Leopard 2 armor is designed to withstand large-caliber kinetic energy penetrators and molded charge projectiles. In the 1980s, the front of the Leopard 2 was estimated to resist 1,500 mm armor-piercing-fin stabilized Destruction-blocking (APFSDS) bullets fired from a distance of 125mm.
Based on unofficial measurements and estimates made by former conscripts and professional soldiers of the German Army, the Leopard 2a4's armor has a physical thickness of up to 800 millimeters (31 inches) in Leopard 2a5 and later models, with a wedge-shaped armor module increasing the thickness to 1,500 millimeters (59 inches).
The sides and rear of the tank protect against heavy machine guns, medium-caliber rounds and old type tank ammunition. The sides of the hull are covered with an armored skirt, which increases protection against projectiles and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). The front 3/1 of the hull side is covered with a heavy ballistic skirt, and the rest of the hull side is covered with a rubber skirt reinforced with steel. For increased protection against mining, the hull floor side is sloped by 45° and the floor is reinforced with corrugated.
Secondary protection
The design of Leopard 2 follows the concept of compartmentalization. A possible source of fire or explosion has been moved away from the crew. In the turret, ammunition and hydraulics are in a compartment separated from the crew. In case of explosion, the blow-off panel of the compartment roof directs the explosion and fire away from the crew. The Leopard 2 is equipped with the Dräger NBC overpressure system, which provides overpressure up to 4hPA inside the vehicle.
4 groups of Wegman 76mm smoke mortars are mounted on both sides of the turret and fired electrically with either a single round or 4 salvos They are mounted on most Leopard 2 models, except for the Dutch Leopard2, which is instead equipped with a smoke mortar system designed by the Netherlands, and each gun is equipped with a smoke mortar system. There are 6 barrels on the side. The Swedish Stridsvagn122 utilizes the French GALIX smoke dispenser, similar to the system found in the French Leclerc.
Leopard 2 is equipped with a fire protection system. 4, 9 kg Halon fire extinguisher bottles are installed on the right behind the driver's station. The bottle is connected to the tube and hose and an excess 2.5kg halon fire extinguisher, whose temperature is raised above 82°C (180°F) inside the combat chamber, or manually by the control panel in the driver compartment, is kept on the floor under the main gun.
Armor upgrades
After the Leopard 2 was introduced to service in 1979, the armor has gradually improved over the years. From the 97th formation of the 6th Formation, a modified version of the multi-layer armor was introduced. The same batch also introduced an improved type of heavy ballistic skirt.
The Leopard 2a5 upgrade focused on enhanced armor protection. When upgrading a Leopard 2 tank to a Leopard 2a5 configuration, the roof covering the armor module is cut open and a new armor module is inserted. New additional armor modules made of laminated armor cover the front arc of the turret. They have a distinctive arrowhead shape, improving protection against both kinetic penetrators and shaped charges. The side skirt also incorporates improved armor protection. The 25mm thick spall liner reduces the risk of injury to the crew if the armor penetrates.
The Leopard2A7 features the latest generation of passive armor and berry armor, providing protection against mines and Ieds. Leopard2A7 is equipped with an adapter for installing additional armor modules or a system of protection against Rpg.
For urban combat, the Leopard 2 can be fitted with different packages of modular armor. The Leopard2A4M CAN, Leopard2PSO (Peace Support Operations), and Leopard2A7 can install thick modules of composite armor along the sides of the turret and hull, while the slat armor can be adapted to the rear of the vehicle. The armor module provides protection against the RPG-7 and can penetrate between 280 mm (11 inches) and 600 mm (24 inches) of steel armor, depending on the warhead. The Leopard2A6M can increase protection against rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) by adding slat armor.
Additional armor packages are developed by many different companies. IBD Deisenroth has developed an upgrade using MEXAS and Advanced Modular Armor Protection (AMAP) combined armor, the latter being used in Leopard 2 tanks in Singapore and Indonesia. RUAG has developed an armor upgrade using the SidePRO-ATR combined armor. The upgrade was first announced at IAV2013.
The Leopard 2A4M and 2A6M add an additional mine protection plate for the belly, which increases protection against mine and Ied.
In 2021/2/22, the German Ministry of Defense has agreed to acquire the trophy, which is an active protection system of Israeli design. 17 German tanks will be equipped with this system, and integration is expected to be completed in 2023.
Estimate of armor
The Leopard2's estimated defense levels range from 590〜690mm Rhe on the turret, glacis on the Leopard2A4 and lower front hull 600mm Rhe, 920〜940mm Rhe on the turret, 620mm Rhe on glacis, and lower front hull on the leopard2A6.
According to an explanatory page organized by the Federation of American Scientists, the Leopard 2a4 armor is believed to provide protection equivalent to 700 mm armored steel (RHA) against kinetic energy penetrators and 1000 mm rha against molded charge warheads.
Armed
Primary
The main armament of the production version of the Leopard 2 was the Rheinmetall 120mm smooth-cavity gun, the same gun that later came to be used on the M1 Abrams, with either the L/44 variant (found on all production models from the Leopard2s to the A5) or the L/55 variant (found on Leopard2A6 and later models). It is used in either. The ammunition for the gun was stored in a special magazine in the front of the hull on the left side of the driver's seat with 27 rounds, and a further 15 rounds stored on the left side of the turret, which was separated from the battle chamber by an electric door.
If you hit the ammunition storage area, the blow-off panel on the turret roof will direct the explosion upward from the crew room. The gun is perfectly stable and can fire various types of bullets, including the German DM2,000APFSDS-T anti-tank Round, which is said to be able to penetrate 560 mm (22 inches) of steel armor in the range of 2,23 meters (12 yd) and the German DM12 High-explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT).
The L/55 gun introduced a newer APFSDS-T round to take advantage of the longer barrel, the DM-2,000, which is said to be able to penetrate 750mm of Rae armor with a range of 53 meters. The heat sleeves of the a4 and A5 hole evacuator and gun are manufactured from glass-reinforced plastic designed to adjust the temperature of the barrel. The barrel has a chrome lining that increases the life of the barrel. The main gun is capable of power rising from +20° to -9°.
Rheinmetall has developed a Leopard 2 tank upgrade to give the ability to fire Israeli Rahat anti-tank guided missiles through the main gun. The missile can engage the target to a range of 6,000 meters (20,000 feet).
Secondary
The Leopard 2 is equipped with 2 machine guns, 1 mounted coaxially, and the other 1 mounted on an anti-aircraft gun. The German model uses the MG3 7.62mm machine gun, the Dutch and Singapore models use the FN MAG7.62 mm machine gun, and the Swiss model uses the Swiss MG87 7.5mm machine gun. 4,750 machine gun ammunition is mounted on the Leopard 2. More recent variants, such as the Leopard2A7+, can be installed near the commander's hatch, a remotely controlled weapons station with a Browning M2HB heavy machine gun.
Fire control
The standard fire control system installed on the Leopard 2 is the German EMES15 fire control system, which has a stable main sight with double magnification. The main sight includes a neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet Nd:YAG laser rangefinder and a 120-element mercury-cadmium telluride HgCdTe (also known as CMT) Zeiss thermography camera, both linked to the tank's fire control computer. The backup 8x auxiliary telescope FERO-Z18 is coaxially attached for gunners.
The commander has an independent periscope, Rheinmetall/Zeiss PERI-R17A2. This is a stabilized panoramic periscope sight designed for day/night observation and target identification. It provides all round views with a 360° traverse. Thermal images from the commander's periscope are displayed on the monitor in the tank. Early production tanks were not equipped with thermal sites because the sight was not ready, and instead temporarily replaced the PZB200low light TV system (LLLTV).
The fire control suite is capable of delivering range values of up to 4 in 3 seconds. Range data is transmitted to the fire control computer and is used to calculate the shooting solution. The laser rangefinder is integrated into the gunner's main sight, allowing the gunner to read the digital range measurements directly. The maximum range of the laser rangefinder is in this range up to 10 m with measuring accuracy within 10,000 m. The combined system allows the leopard 2 to engage moving targets in a range of up to 5,000 meters while being on a move over rough terrain.
Driving force
Leopard2 is propelled by the MTU MB873Ka-501 engine. It delivers at 2600 RPM at 1,500PS (1.1MW) and at 1600-1700 RPM at 4,700 N º m (3,500lb º ft) of torque. The MTU MB873Ka-501 is a 4-stroke, 47.7-liter, 90°V block 12-cylinder, twin turbocharger, intercooler, liquid-cooled diesel engine with multi-fuel function. It has an estimated fuel consumption rate of about 300 km per 100 liters on the road and 500 km per 100 liters nationwide and is coupled with the Renk HSWL354 gear and brake system.
The Renk HSWL354 transmission features 4 forward and 2 reverse gears with torque converters, which are fully automated with the driver choosing the range. Leopard 2 has 4 fuel tanks, the total capacity is about 1,160 liters, and the maximum road distance is about 500 km. The propulsion pack can drive the tank to a maximum speed of 68 km/h (by law it is limited to 50 km/h in peacetime) and a maximum reverse speed of 31 km/h. The engine and transmission are separated from the crew room through fireproof bulkheads. An enhanced version of EuroPowerPack with a 1,650PS (1.2MW) MTU MT883 engine is being tested by Leopard 2.
The Leopard 2 has a torsion bar suspension with advanced friction dampers. The running gear consists of 7 dual rubber weary road wheels and 4 return rollers per side, with idler wheels on the front and drive sprockets on the rear. The track is a Diehl570f track, with rubber bush end connectors, removable rubber pads, and uses 82 links for each track. For use on icy ground, up to 18 rubber pads can be replaced with the same number of grousers, and when not in use, they are stored in the bow of the vehicle. The top of the track is covered with a side skirt.
The Leopard 2 can use a snorkel or 1.2 meters (3 feet 11 inches) to drive through water as deep as 4 meters (13 feet) without preparation. It can climb vertical obstacles with a height of more than 1 meter.
The German army has given priority to the maneuverability of the Leopard 2, making it one of the fastest Mbt in the world 1.
The Ukrainian army says that the Leopard 2 tank is only slightly larger than a diesel van. They argue that this lack of noise gives a tactical advantage during an ambush. One Ukrainian commander estimated that the Russian army only heard Leopard 200 from 2 meters during the ambush. Compared with 2-3 kg of tanks of the former Soviet era.
Export
Germany has deployed about 2,125 Leopard 2 main battle tanks in various versions, many of which were sold after German reunification. The Leopard2 was very popular in the 1990s, when the shrinking German army offered many of the redundant Leopard2s at low prices. In Europe, it was successful enough that the manufacturers began to call it the Euro Leopard, despite the fact that France, Britain and Italy all operate their own MBTs. In addition, in non-European orders, the name "Global-Leopard" is used instead. The Leopard 2 tank is also resold by original export customers, but re-export is always subject to the consent of the German government, which manages the platform's export license. In other countries, they buy newly manufactured vehicles or produce them locally under a license.
Europe
The Netherlands, after examining the results of the Leopard2AV in the United States, in 1979 3/2 ordered 445 Leopard2 tanks. It became the first export customer of Leopard 2 and was delivered between 1981-7 and 1986-7. The Dutch Leopard 2 tanks were then exported to Austria, Canada, Norway and Portugal. The Leopard 2 tank, which remains in service in the Netherlands, has been upgraded to the 2A5 and 2A6 standards.
After testing both tanks from 1981-8 to 1982-6, the Swiss Army decided to buy more Leopard 2 tanks than the M1A1 Abrams. The Swiss decision was made in 1983, and funding was approved by the government in 1984. 35 of the tanks were delivered by Kraus-Maffei by 1987-6. In 1987-12, the company began licensed production of 345 additional vehicles.
After studying alternative options for the Strv103 tanks developed locally, Sweden decided to purchase a foreign tank model. The Leopard2 improved version (the Leopard2A5 prototype) won the competition between the M1A2 Abrams and the French Leclerc. The Swedish army also rated the Soviet T-80U tank, but separately from other tanks. After intensive testing from 1994-1 to 6 months, the Swedish army chose Leopard 2. The Swedish Army has found that the Leopard 2 meets 90% of military demand. M1A2 met Swedish requirements by 86%, while Leclerc met 63%. In 1994-6, Sweden ordered the production of a 120-modified Leopard2A5, known as Stridsvagn122 (Strv122) in Swedish service. The Strv122 features Swedish-developed armor, a new command system, and improved electronics. Of the 120 Strv122, 29 were manufactured by Krauss-Maffei Wegmann in Germany, while the other 91 were manufactured by Swedish companies Bofors and Hägglunds. The first Stridsvagn122 was delivered in 1996-12. These remain in service in Sweden and are undergoing regular upgrades.
Sweden also leased and purchased in 1994 and 1995 a total of 160 Leopard 2a4 tanks (known in Swedish service as Stridsvagn121 (Strv121)). The first Strv121 was delivered in 1994/2. The fleet of Strv121 was dismantled by 2006. There are many Strv121 tanks available for training in Sweden, with 6 of the Strv121 converted into AEV3 Kodiak armored vehicles and 6 of the Leguan armored vehicles.
Denmark bought 51 former German Leopard2A4 tanks after Hærens Kampskole, a Danish military school, recommended the adoption of a new tank based on a Swedish army test. The first tank was delivered in 1998, but the upgrade to the Leopard 2a5 level was already decided the following year. From 2004 to 2006, the Danish Army purchased another German Leopard 2 tank.
In 1998, Greece held a competition to determine the main battle tanks of the Greek army. The Leopard2 is better than the Challenger2E, Leclerc, M1A2Abrams, T-80U and T-84 and was chosen by the Greek authorities. In 2003/3, Greece ordered 170 Leopard 2 tanks, of which 140 were assembled on site. Greece also bought 183Leopard2A4 and 150Leopard1 tanks.
Spain initially leased 109 Leopard 2A4s, a special lightweight version of the Leopard 2 developed with Santa Bárbara Sistemas after Krauss-Maffei withdrew from the Lince development. Before the rinse tank was finished, Spain had already rejected the M1A1 Abrams and Vickers Valiant. After the decision to purchase the leased tank, Santa Bárbara Sistemas was licensed to produce the 219Leopard2A6 tank locally for the Spanish army.
Poland in 2002 received 128 Leopard2A4 tanks from the stock of the German army. In 2002 and 2003, Finland purchased 124 second-hand Leopard2A4 tanks and 6 armored bridge layer Leopard2L tanks from Germany. The tank served as a replacement for the old Soviet-made T-55 and T-72M1. The Netherlands resold 114 tanks (and 1 turret) to Austria, 80 to Canada in 2007, 52 to Norway, 37 to Portugal, and 100 to Finland.
In 2018/12, Hungary ordered 44 Leopard2A7+s and 12 second-hand 2A4s, coinciding with the procurement of 24 Panzerhaubitze2000, which was expected to replace Hungary's current t-72 tanks "earlier than 2020."
In 2023/2, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere announced that Norway will order 54 Leopard 2a7 tanks at a cost of nkr19.7 billion, adding the option to deliver 18 vehicles at a later date. The first Leopard 2A7 will be delivered by 2026 and will be operational by 2031. The Norwegian government was considering either the Leopard2A4 or the Korean K2Black Panther as an alternative to the aging Leopard2A7. The tank will be designated Leopard 2A8NOR.
Beyond Europe
In 2005, Turkey ordered 298 Leopard 2 tanks from the German army. Leopard2 was chosen in 2001 after successful competition with the version of the T-84Yatagan, Leclerc and M1A2Abrams equipped with a German MTU diesel engine in the Turkish military trials. Turkey wanted to buy 1,000 Leopard2 cars in 1999, but the German government refused the deal.
In 2006, Singapore purchased 96 Leopard 2 tanks from Germany. Chile bought in 2007 172 former German Leopard2A4 tanks and 273 Marder1A3Ifv.
Indonesia ordered 103 Leopard 2 tanks and 42 MARDER1A3IFVS in 2013. Initially, the export of heavy weapons to Indonesia was not authorized by the German government due to Indonesia's questionable human rights record. Of the 103 Leopard 2 tanks, 61 will be upgraded to the Leopard 2ri standard by Rheinmetall based on Rheinmetall's Revolution modular upgrade concept.
Qatar ordered 62 Leopard 2a7 tanks and 24 Panzerhaubitze2000s in 2013. Delivery of tanks began in late 2015, and the first tanks were exhibited at the military parade in 2015.
Transfer to Ukraine
In 2023/7/2, Ukraine reportedly received 54 Leopard2A4 from NATO members.
Political debate
In the wake of the Russian invasion from 2022-4, the Ukrainian government is asking its allies to donate Western-made main battle tanks. Poland, Finland and others announced that they have about 2 tanks from various states that are ready to transfer Leopard 100 tanks to Ukraine. However, when Germany exported tanks to these countries, they were subject to re-export under the permission of the German government, so as to be based on K R I E G Swaffenkontrollgesetz and Außenwirtschaftsgesetz. Until 2023/1/22, it was unclear whether Germany, determined to avoid the perception that it would escalate the conflict and whether such consent would be provided, was wary of being labeled an aggressor. Germany was also keen to draw on America's commitment to deliver its own M1 Abrams tank before sending the German-made Leopard 2 tank to Ukraine.
The issue was discussed at a meeting of Defense Ministers of NATO members and allies, but no agreement was reached. The German position is that Poland has unilaterally threatened to export leopards if permission from Berlin was not given Some of the other European governments then the governments of Poland and Ukraine announced that Ukrainian soldiers will start training Polish Leopard2 tanks in Poland.
In 2023/1/22, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told French media that Germany "does not get in the way" of Poland's decision to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, but "no questions have been asked at this time.""Two days later, Poland made an official request for permission to transfer Polish leopards to Ukraine.
1/24 Spiegel reported that the German chancellor Olaf Scholz will officially announce the next day the transfer of an undisclosed number of German Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. The German government will also give permission to all countries that are trying to re-export the Leopard 2 tank to Ukraine. These reports were officially confirmed by the German government at 1.25 PM.
It was also reported that the German Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, had encouraged Ukrainians to start training.
Germany's decision to grant and approve the Leopard 2 tank to Ukraine came after US President Biden decided to provide the m1 Abrams tank to Ukraine.Germany had insisted on moving in coordination with its allies. The decision to provide the M1 Abrams tank had previously been opposed by the Department of Defense.
In 2023/2/15, Pistorius expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the German allies announced the donation to Ukraine of Leopard 2 tanks, and since the change in Germany's position on exports "in a calm manner, not at all breathtaking", only Poland had matched Germany's promise to deliver 14 tanks - two tanks from a single country. The biggest donation.
Germany
In 2023/1/25, the German government has confirmed that it will provide 14 Leopard2A6 (the number that is the strength of the company) for Ukraine and allow the re-export of the vehicle to its European partners. The goal is for the European Leopard 2 operator to provide Ukraine with 2 battalions, or 88 tanks.
According to the German government, the tanks will be delivered to Ukraine after training Ukrainian service personnel. This process can take up to 3 months. Some tanks are held by the German Federal Army, while others are held by Leopard manufacturer Rheinmetall. The latter states that it is ready to be dispatched by 2023-3. But they also warned that some of the long-stored vehicles would require extensive refurbishment and updates before they considered them suitable for combat in Ukraine. 1/26, German Defense Minister Pistorius said the tank will be delivered in late May 3 or early May 4. In 2023/2/24, the German Ministry of Defense confirmed that Germany will increase the contribution of Leopard2A6 from 14 to 18, providing 1 all-tank battalion along with the contribution of Portugal and Sweden.
In 2023/3/27, Germany delivered 18 Leopard 2A6 tanks to Ukraine, equipped with 2 armored vehicles and the necessary spare parts.
In 2023/3/28, the Security Committee of the Swiss National Council recommended that the 25Leopard2 in storage be sold to the German manufacturer Krauss-Maffei-Wegmann so that Germany could replace some of its own tanks currently in use in Ukraine. As of this date, Switzerland has kept 96Leopard2. The German Bundestag will wait for the approval of the Swiss Parliament, as decommissioning is necessary for the sale of tanks.
In 2023/9/27, the Swiss Parliament voted to abolish 25 Leopard 2 tanks and allow them to be sold to Germany. Germany guarantees that the former Swiss tanks will not be sent to Ukraine.
Poland
The Polish government announced on 1/25 that it would transfer 50-60 Soviet-era tanks, plus 247 to 14 leopards in total Polish stock to Ukraine, and welcomed Germany's decision to allow the transfer of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. In 2023/2/24, the first 4 Leopard 2a4 tanks from the Polish stock were delivered to Ukraine. These were the first Leopard 2 tanks to be operated in Ukraine.
Canada
In 2023/1/26, Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand announced that Canada will send Leopard 2A4 4 tanks to Ukraine. These vehicles were reportedly "ready for battle.""Canada will also provide appropriate training to Ukrainian troops who will go to operate these tanks. The first Canadian Leopard 2 tank arrived in Poland on 2/5, allowing the Ukrainian army to begin training. 2/24 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canada will send another 4 Leopard2A4 tanks, 1 armored recovery vehicle (ARV) and 5,000 rounds of ammunition to Ukraine.
Czech Republic
In 2023/1/20, the Czech Ministry of Defense issued a statement saying that media reports indicating that the Czech Republic and Slovakia are willing to abandon the Leopard 2 tank for Ukraine are false, and that rumors that the Czech Republic will receive an American Abrams tank in exchange for Leopard are also false. As of 2022/12, both countries had received 1 Leopard 2a4 each from Rheinmetall as part of the German Ringtaush program, while the rest of the Leopard 2a4 is still being refurbished (due to be delivered throughout 2023).
Denmark
It was reported in the international press that Denmark had indicated that it could contribute to many tanks, but there was no official instruction from the Danish government that Leopard 2's will be sent to Ukraine. Of Denmark's stock of 44 tanks, 14 were deployed to Estonia as part of the NATO EFP, and many more were upgraded by German manufacturers. Some Danish opposition politicians have voiced support for the transfer of Danish tanks. Unlike those considered in other countries, the Danish leopard is the new 2A7 standard, which table some logistical and mechanical challenges compared to other subspecies Instead Denmark announced that it will buy 2-7 100-178Leopard1A5 tanks in collaboration with Germany and the Netherlands. Denmark also announced that in 2023/4/20, in collaboration with the Netherlands, it will fund the purchase and renovation of 14Leopard2A4 from private company shares for Ukraine.
Finland
Finland had proposed that a limited number of Leopard 2 tanks could be supplied to Ukraine before Germany decided to re-export. "We cannot increase the number of tanks because Finland borders Russia and is not part of NATO," said Finnish President Sauli Niinisto."Finland announced on the 23rd that it will provide Ukraine with 3 Leopard 2R demining vehicles. The total stock in Finland of this type will buy 3 replacement cars from Germany, returning the same (6).
Greece
It was reported that in 2023/1/25, Greece was one of the countries that had indicated that it would supply the Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine 1. In 2023/1/29, it was incorrectly reported that about 14 Leopard2 tanks would be offered, but it was unclear whether it was a 2A4 or 2A6HEL variant. However, on 1/31, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mittakis made clear that Greece will not supply leopard tanks to Ukraine, arguing that "they are absolutely necessary for our defensive posture."The leaked Pentagon documents revealed that Greece was preparing to donate 5 tanks of its Leopard 2 to Ukraine, but Greek Defense Minister Nikolaos Panayiotopoulos repeated his government's opposition to the delivery of the tank to Ukraine, making the confirmation of delivery uncertain.
Netherlands
The Netherlands was considering a request for Ukrainian Leopard 2 tanks, and Prime Minister Mark Rutte suggested that the Dutch government could buy and donate tanks from other countries. There was also debate over the purchase of 18 Leopard 2a6 tanks leased by the Netherlands from Germany. Since no formal purchase request was made, the two countries did not refuse to sell from Germany and agreed that it was important for the operation of the German-Dutch Joint Military Unit. However, the Netherlands has agreed to supply ammunition to the Leopard tank, announcing that it has not abandoned its intention to contribute to the tank initiative, and also mentioned that it is contributing to the purchase of the Leopard 1a5 tank with Denmark and Germany. The Netherlands later announced that it was working with Denmark to raise funds to purchase and refurbish 14Leopard2A4 for Ukraine from private industrial stocks, with deliveries expected in early 2024.
Norway
In 2023/1/25, Norway promised to donate spare leopards to Ukraine, and there were reports speculating that of the 36 Leopard 2A4 tanks 4 to 8 will be sent. "Norway and the government support the donation of tanks to Ukraine," Norwegian Defense Minister Bjorn Aryld Glam said in an interview with Norwegian public television NRK. Norway did not participate, but "but specify how many will be sent." In 2023/2/14, Gram announced that it will hand over 8 Norwegian Leopard2 tanks and 4 "special purpose vehicles" derived from Leopard1 to Ukraine. A special purpose car turned out to be a combination of 3NM189Aev and 1NM217ARV. In 2023/2, Norway ordered the delivery of 54 Leopard 2A7 tanks (later changed to the 2A8 variant) from 2026, adding 18 additional options as needed.
Portugal
When the German government changed its position on re-export of Leopard 2 tanks, the Portuguese government was preparing to send 2A6 of the Leopard 4 tanks to Ukraine on 4 March, Prime Minister Antonio Costa confirmed that Portugal would send leopards to Ukraine, but did not confirm the number of vehicles to be delivered. It is understood that Portugal is working with Germany to obtain the parts needed to repair the inoperable tanks in stock of 37 Leopard 2 tanks, but it is widely reported by local media that most are inoperable. Costa said it expects the Portuguese tanks to be delivered by 2023/3. On 2/14, it was reported that Portugal had earmarked 3 Leopard2A6 tanks for donations to Ukraine. It was confirmed that all 3 aircraft were donated on the 27th, along with 18 German Leopard 2A6 aircraft. Leaked Pentagon documents revealed that Portugal may donate an additional 3Leopard2A6 tank to Ukraine.
Slovakia
In 2023/1/25, Slovakia announced that it was not considering the transfer of the Leopard 2a4 tank to Ukraine, but was willing to offer the T-72 tank if other allies replaced it with other tanks. The reason was that Slovakia had received only 1 of the 15 Leopard tanks promised as part of the German "Ringtaush program" in exchange for supplying Ukraine with 30 Soviet-era infantry fighting vehicles.
Spain
In 2022/6/4, it was reported that Spain is considering providing 53 of the 40 retired Leopard2A4 tanks stored in Zaragoza. 6/8 German Prime Minister Olaf Scholz has refused to formally request permission from Spain to export Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. However, it was confirmed on 6/10 that the Spanish defense minister was considering relocating. 6/12 An anonymous government source told Der Spiegel that the Scholz government had blocked the transfer of Leopard tanks to Ukraine, arguing that this "constitutes a departure" from the informal NATO decision not to provide Western tanks of the time. By 8/2, Spain had officially backtracked on its decision, claiming that the tanks in Zaragoza were in a "deplorable state" and could not send anything.
It was later reported that the Spanish government was considering sending an unidentified number of Spanish Leopard1 tanks to Ukraine in 2023, following a meeting of the Ukrainian Defense Liaison Group. 2/14 Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles confirmed that Spain is providing training on Leopard 2 to 55 Ukrainian tank crews and engineers. 2/22 Robles confirmed that Spain is preparing 3 or 4 6 Leopard 2A4 tanks for delivery to Ukraine by late May or early May. In 2023/2/5, it was reported that of the 53 cars stored in Zaragoza, at least 11 were not stored to be refurbished and upgraded to have "the same lethality" as the modern version of Leopard 2 before being sent to Ukraine. 5 were sent to the Santa Bárbara Sistemas plant in Alcala de Guadaira, and 6 had already been transferred to Seville for diagnosis and repair. The Ministry of Defense had not announced a contract for the renovation in secret. However, it was unclear whether ammunition would be supplied to the tank, as Spain had only 2 rounds in each of the Leopard 9e tanks. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez confirmed on March 23 that Spain was sending at least 10 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine during a visit to Kiev.
Sweden
Sweden began to consider the request for the Ukrainian Leopard tank in 2023/1 and did not rule out the contribution of Strv122 at a later stage. 2/24 Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson announced that Sweden will provide Ukraine with 10 Leopard2A5 tanks.
Battle history
KFOR
From 1999-6-12, 28 Leopard 2a5 tanks were deployed to Kosovo by the German Army as part of the Kosovo Army (KFOR). Panzerbataillon 33 and 214 vehicles were sent from Macedonia to Prizren. They were used for patrols, protecting checkpoints and bases, and as part of a show of force. In 1999, 6/13, 2 members of the Serbian paramilitary group began firing from inside a Fiat 1p car at one of the checkpoints in Prizren, where they were both killed in the return fire. At the checkpoint was located Leopard 2a5, but only partially there was a crew, so it was not possible to take part in the battle.
1999 6/26 Leopard 2a5 fired 4 warning shots over the town of Olahovac. In late 2000 and early 2001, the tank was replaced by the Leopard 2a4 model. Leopard 2A4 was deployed to Macedonia in 2001 as part of NATO intervention. The tanks helped to protect the logistics facilities of the Federal Army in Macedonia. Until their return in 2004, the Leopard 2 tanks were stationed in the Austrian-Swiss camp "Casablanca".
IFOR/SFOR
The Dutch army in Bosnia and Herzegovina operated 2 tanks. The Dutch Leopard2A4 and Leopard2A5 were stationed at NLD bases in Bugojno, Novi Travnik, Sisava, Knezevo, Maslovare and Suica.
ISAF/OEF
In 2003-10, Canada planned to replace the Leopard C2 with a wheeled striker mobile gun system. However, operational experience in Afghanistan, especially during Operation Medusa, convinced the Canadian army of the usefulness of maintaining a tank fleet. The Leopard C2 was deployed in Kandahar in 2006-12, but by then it had been nearly 30 years old and was nearing the end of its operational life. The Canadian government has decided to rent 20 Leopard2A6 and 3 armored recovery vehicles from Germany for rapid deployment to Afghanistan. Late 2007-8, the first Leopard 2 was airlifted to Afghanistan to equip Lord Strathcona's horse (Royal Canadian).
In the 2007-11-2 attack, Leopard2A6M hit an improvised explosive device (ied) and survived without casualties: "My crew stumbled upon an ied (improvised Explosive Device) and (Leopard2A6)M packet it worked as it needed."" wrote a Canadian officer in an email to a German defense official. Canadian Defense Chief of Staff General Rick Hillier denied reports that the Leopard 2 tank attacked by the Ied had been written off, claiming that the tank had been repaired and used again. "The Taliban have engaged with some of the new Leopard 2 tanks in several ambushes," and as a result, the Taliban "learned some very tough lessons" and "defeated very quickly and very hard" in the battle in question."
In 2007-10, Denmark deployed Leopard 2A5DKS to support operations in southern Afghanistan. The Danish tank unit, drawn from the first Battalion of the Jutland Dragoon Regiment, was equipped with three tanks and an m113 armored personnel carrier, and an armored recovery vehicle and another tank were stored in reserve. The Danish version of the Leopard 2A5 is fitted with a made-in-Sweden barracuda camouflage mat, which limits the absorption of solar heat and therefore reduces the infrared signature and interior temperature. It also features a conventional driver's seat bolted to the tank floor, but in Canada's 2A6M (as part of a mine protection package), the driver's seat is replaced by a "dynamic safety seat" - a parachute harness-like arrangement that the driver wears around his waist. This way, the driver has no contact with the hull other than the pedal and is out of the explosion mine or IEDs shock wave area.
In 2008/1, Danish tanks stopped an adjacent maneuver by Taliban forces near the Helmand River and provided gunfire to support Danish and British infantry from a high position. 2008/2/26 Danish Leopard 2 was attacked by an explosive device, damaging 1 truck. No one was injured and the tank returned to the camp alone for repair. The first death suffered by the crew operating the Leopard 2 occurred in 2008 at 7.25 AM. A Danish leopard 2A5 attacked an IED in Helmand Province. The vehicle was able to continue 200 meters (656 feet) before stopping. Despite the injuries, 4 members of the 3 crew managed to escape, but the driver was stuck inside. Local treatment by Danish doctors could not save him. The vehicle was towed to the Forward Operations Base (FOB Attal) and then towed to FOB Armadillo for investigation and redeployment. During the same contact with the Taliban forces, the 2nd tank was involved in the explosion, but none of the crew was injured.
From 2008-12-7, the Leopard 2 tanks participated in Operation Red Dagger and fired 31 rounds to support the Allied forces to recapture the Nad Ali district. A press release from the British Ministry of Defence claimed that the Leopard 2 was a decisive factor in the Union's success and praised the tank's shooting accuracy and maneuverability.
Turkish intervention in Syria
Turkey operates a 354Leopard2A4 tank. Initially it used other types of tanks, including the upgraded M60, but in 2016-12, Turkey deployed a number of Leopard 2A4s in the Syrian Civil War against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) as part of Operation Euphrates Shield. Initially, three of the Turkish Leopard2a4s operating in Syria were destroyed or damaged by ISIS using an anti-tank missile system (probably Fagot or Konkurs anti-tank guided missiles obtained from strains captured by Syrian or Iraqi forces). In mid-2016, 12 tanks, 2A4 and 2, were captured by ISIS near the Syrian city of Al-Bab during operation Shield on the Euphrates River. The Amaq news agency posted a video of the vehicle claiming to have captured the Leopard 2a4s.
By late 2016/12, ISIS had captured or neutralized 10 leopard2a4s, but these were damaged by anti-tank weapons, Ieds, or other unknown causes. Additional ISIS propaganda images and videos depicting some completely destroyed leopards, some turrets blown away, were released in 2017/1. The worst-affected tanks may have been destroyed by air strikes to prevent capture, but sources generally state that the damage was caused only by anti-tank missiles or car bombs driven by suicide bombers.
In March 2017, the German newspaper Die Welt reported that ISIL fighters used 9M133Kornet anti-tank missiles to destroy 6 Leopard 2 tanks used by the Turkish army in Syria.
Photo reports show that at least 8 Leopard2MBT have been destroyed.
Turkey also confirmed the use of the Leopard 2a4 tank during Turkish military operations in Afrin to the German government. These tanks were designed during the Cold War to fight Soviet tanks in Europe, not to counterattack against guerrillas, whose main risk is improvised explosive devices and anti-tank missiles. These tanks retired from use in Germany when they were sold to Turkey.
There is a belief that the Turkish purchase of Leopard 2A4s from Germany was subject to the condition that it should not be used against Kurdish separatists.Prior to 2016, Leopard 2a4s was stored in northern Turkey. When the German government discovered that the Leopard tank was being used against Kurdish forces, an upgrade planned to make it "not vulnerable to explosives" was halted. Eventually Turkey was forced to upgrade the Leopard 2A4s with domestic parts, with the possibility of replacing the original turret with the turrets of Turkey's Altay main battle tank.
Russian-Ukrainian War
In 2023/4, during the training of the Ukrainian crew, the Leopard 2a4 was damaged, and the turret was completely removed from the hull. The crew was reported as fine. In 2023/7, the Leopard 2A4 was modified to include the Kontakt-1ERA on the hull and turret sides. It was also shown by a rubber screen attached to the turret and gun mantelpiece.
From 2023-6, Ukraine deployed Leopard2 during the Russian・Ukrainian War with Russia in preparation for the 2023 counterattack. During the 2023 6/8 Ukrainian offensive in Zaporozhye Province, Russian shelling against Ukrainian vehicle columns in Novopoklovka destroyed at least 1 Leopard 2a4 tank. In addition, more Russian drone footage from the same day and the next day showed that 4 Leopard2A6 tanks and 3 Leopard2RS damaged or destroyed the road south of Mala Tokmachka.
In 2023/8/28, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed that Russian troops destroyed or damaged all 16 Leopard 2a4 tanks supplied to Ukraine from Poland and Portugal.
As of 2023-10-28, according to the blog of ORIX, at least 11 Ukrainian Leopard2 were destroyed according to photos and videos (3Leopard2A6, 2Leopard2A4, 4Leopard2A4V, 1Leopard2R, 1Bergepanzer-3); another 14 Ukrainian Leopards of various models were destroyed. It was confirmed that Leopard2 was damaged to varying degrees, of which 5 have been classified as abandoned by the crew: 4Leopard2A4, 6Leopard2A6, 3 have been abandoned, 2 Stridsvagn122 have also been destroyed.He lost 2r to 2r.
According to Forbes, in 2023-10-4, the Ukrainian army managed to recover at least 1 Strv122 and sent it to repair.
Subspecies
Leopard 2
The baseline Leopard 2 was the first series production version, sometimes informally referred to as "A0" to distinguish it from later versions. The vehicles were manufactured from 1979-10 to 1982-3, with a total of 380 vehicles. 209 was built by Krauss Maffei and 171 by MaK. The basic equipment consisted of an electro-hydraulic stabilizer WNA-H22, a fire control computer, a laser rangefinder, a wind sensor, a general purpose telescope EMES15, a panoramic periscope PERI R17, a gunner's main aim FERO Z18, a turret roof and a computer-controlled tank test set RPP1-8. The 200 vehicles were equipped with a low-light enhancer (PZB200) instead of an infrared image. Two chassis served driver training car.
Leopard 2A1
Minor modifications and the installation of the gunner's thermal sight were incorporated into the 450th batch of Leopard2 2 cars and designated A1. Krauss-Maffei 248 (Chassis Nr.10211-10458), Mak 202 (chassis Nr.20173-20347). Delivery of the 2A1 model began in 1982/3 and ended in 1983/11. The two most notable changes were the modification of the ammunition rack to be identical to that of the M1a1 Abrams, and the redesign of the fuel filter to reduce refueling time.
The 300th batch of 2leopard 3, 165 by Krauss-Maffei (Chassis Nr.10459-10623) and 135 by MaK (Chassis Nr.20375-20509).It was built between 1983 and 1984. This batch included more minor changes that were later retrofitted to the previous 2A1.
Leopard 2A2
This designation was given to upgraded vehicles in the first batch of Leopard 2 and was raised to the standard in the 2nd and 3rd batches. This modernization gradually replaced the original PZB200 sights of the first batch with thermal sites for emes15. The upgrade included attaching filler openings and caps to the forward hull fuel tank to allow for separate refueling. A deflector plate for the periscope and a large cover plate to protect the existing NBC protection system have been added. The tank was given a new 5-meter traction cable with different positions. The program began in 1984 and ended in 1987. The 3rd, 4th and 5th batches produced during this period had the same characteristics. The modernized first batch can be confirmed by a circular plate where a crosswind sensor for the fire control system covers the removed hole.
Leopard 2A3
From 1984-12 to 1985-12, 165 cars (chassis Nr.10624-10788) and 135 Mak cars (chassis Nr.20510-20644) of 300 vehicles were delivered in the 4th batch. The main changes were the addition of the SEM80/90 digital radio set (also installed on the Leopard 1 at the same time) and the welding shutdown of the ammunition reload hatch. Even with these minor changes, the new batch was known as 2A3.
Leopard 2A4
The most popular version of the Leopard 2 family, the 2A4 model included more substantial changes, including an automated fire and explosion suppression system, an all-digital fire control system capable of handling new ammunition types, and an improved turret with flat titanium/tungsten armor. Leopard2s was manufactured between 1985 and 1992 in 8 batches. All older models have been upgraded to the 2A4 standard. Until 1994, Germany operated a total of 2,125 2a4s (695 were newly manufactured and the rest modified the old version), while the Netherlands had an additional 445 tanks. The 2A4 was licensed in Switzerland as the Panzer 87 "Leopard" or Pz87. This version included a Swiss-made 7.5mm MG87 machine gun and communications equipment, equipped with an improved NBC protection system. Switzerland operated 380 Pz87 tanks.
After 2000, Germany and the Netherlands had a large number of tanks that they did not need after the Cold War. These tanks were sold to NATO and friendly troops around the world. Among the buyers of these surplus tanks were Turkey (354), Greece (183), Sweden (160), Chile (140), Finland (139), Poland (128), Austria (114), Spain (108), Canada (107), Indonesia (103). Singapore (96), Norway (52), Denmark (51) and Portugal (37).
The Pz87WE (Verterhartung) is a modification and upgrade of the pz87 planned in Switzerland. This change adds a Leopard 2a6m mine protection kit, thick armor on the front and a turret with a Swiss-developed armor package using titanium alloy, which significantly improves protection. The armor on the turret roof has been improved and the Smoke Grenade Launcher has been redesigned. Further improvements have enhanced survivability and combat capabilities, including an electric turret drive similar to the Leopard 2a5, a driver's rearview camera, a separate weapon station for loaders, and an enhanced command and control system. The fire control system has been upgraded using the Carl Zeiss Optronics GmbH PERI-R17A2 fire control system. A remote weapons station, including a fully stabilized Mg64 0.50 in (12.7mm) machine gun, is attached to the tank.
The Swiss company RUAG has provided an upgrade package for the pz87 main battle tank to meet the possible requirements of the Swiss army for enhanced protection. It is fitted with a new modular composite armor package. Armor modules can be tailored to provide enhanced protection against specific threats. Damaged modules can be easily replaced on site. The upgraded tanks are not vulnerable to direct hits, anti-tank missiles, RPG rounds, mines, and Ied. The vehicle received new sensors such as sniper detection sensors and laser warning receivers. In 2021, 2 prototypes with additional armor were passed to the Militär-und Festungsmuseum Full-Reuenthal.
The Indonesian Army operates Leopard2Republic Indonesia or Leopard2RI, an upgraded variant based on Rheinmetall's MBT Revolutionary upgrade for the Leopard2A4 tank. The upgrade includes IBD Deisenroth and Rheinmetall Chempro's AMAP armor, an improved fire control system, and battlefield management and situational awareness systems.
The Pz87-140 is an experimental variant of the Swiss Pz87, equipped with a 140mm gun and additional armor, which was later used in a new production variant.
The Leopard2A4CHL is an upgraded Chilean version of the Leopard2A4 that Chile ordered in 2007. Upgrades include new electronics to enhance the Leopard 2A4's networking capabilities to the same level as the Leopard 2A6, a new aiming, information system, a new suspension system, and an upgrade of the tank gun used in the Leopard 2a6 to the L/55 Smooth Bore cannon. The other upgrade is a remote weapons station on top of the gunner and commander hatch equipped with MG3 and HK GMG. The Leopard2A4CHL improves the armor of the roof and side turrets and can be uplink in the Chilean battlefield control network.
The Leopard2A4M CAN is an upgraded Canadian version of the Leopard2A4 acquired from the Dutch Army. The Leopard2a4M CAN is designed specifically for the war in Afghanistan, based on the experience gained by the Leopard2 operator. The first 20 were delivered in 2010-10. 5 aircraft were deployed to Afghanistan at the end of 2010 and were in service until 2011-7, when combat operations ceased. It was originally planned to be upgunned to L/2A6M for consistency with the can 55, but a longer barrel (optimized for tank anti-tank warfare) turned out to be not ideal in Afghanistan, so it was decided to hold the L/44. In contrast to the fully caged 2A6M cans, only a small area of slat armor was added. The protection of the Leopard2A4M CAN was further enhanced by the addition of applique armor, as seen in the latest Leopard2A7+ variant, but has been modified to match the turret configuration of the 2A4. Of the 2a4s obtained, 11 were converted for training (9A4S, 2A4Ms). In 2011/2, Canada purchased 12 2A4S/Pz87s from Switzerland for the "Force Mobility Enhancement" project, along with the remaining unused former Dutch tanks, with 18 converted into armored vehicles and 4 converted into armored vehicle recovery vehicles. Canada also purchased 15 2a4s from Germany as logistic standard car (for spare parts).
The Leopard 2ng (Next Generation) is a privately funded Turkish upgrade from ASELSAN, which includes AMAP applications, improved optics, a fully overhauled turret mechanism and a new fire control system for operations since 1995, and is expected to be delivered by late 2011.It is intended to be used in the new Altay MBT. Developed without orders from the Turkish army, but could meet the requirements of modernization of the Turkish Leopard 2A4s.The old power pack and L/44 barrel are retained, but the combat weight has increased to 65 tons. According to a Turkish news source, Finland was interested in obtaining a Turkish upgrade package to modernize its fleet of Leopard 2A4, but in 2015 Finland purchased 120 2A6 vehicles from the Netherlands.
The Leopard 2 hull was used for the Vickers Mk7 main battle tank and had a British-designed turret, but some innovations were later incorporated into the Challenger 2 design.
In 2015/12, Bumar-Labedy signed an agreement with Germany's Rheinmetall Landsysteme Gmbh on technical assistance for the Polish modernization program of the Leopard 2a4 tank. The company designs, documents and executes 6 prototypes. The first upgraded Leopard 2PLS will arrive in Poland in 2020/6, with 142 tanks expected to be delivered by 2023. Upgrades include the 3rd generation night vision system (production of Warsaw PCO), new additional armor modules and splash-proof lining, removal of flammable components (turret drive system and main propulsion system), installation of new fire protection systems, modernization of integrated monitoring and testing equipment of tanks, new types of ammunition (programmable DM-11 and DM -63), and auxiliary generator set (APU). Construction of all 142 units is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.
Turkey plans to modernize the Leopard2A4Mbt as the Leopard2A4TR in the t1 modernization package. According to the President of the defense industry, the Leopard 2a4 tank is equipped with explosive reactive armor (ERA), T1 reactive passive armor, high ballistic strength cage armor, hollow modular add-on armor, close Range Surveillance System (YAMGÖZ), Laser Warning Reception System (LIAS), SARP Remote Control Weapon System (UKSS), PULAT Active Protection System (AKS), new power distribution unit, ASELSAN Driver It is modernized with the integration of monitoring systems (ADIS) and voice warning systems. The modernization program is expected to be completed in 2 batches. The program will begin with 84 Leopard 2a4 tanks in the first batch, with the remaining tanks modernized within the 2nd batch. A total of 334 vehicles (including prototypes) will be upgraded under the t1 modernization program. The new modernized Leopard 2a4, presented at the BMC plant, was equipped with an Altay turret armed with a 120mm55 caliber smooth-bore gun designed and manufactured by the Turkish company MKE, based on technology transfer from Hyundai Rotem in South Korea. At the top of the turret is a remotely operated armory equipped with a 12.7mm caliber heavy machine gun.
Leopard 2A4V
In 2023/9/1, in a video on social media, a Ukrainian crew with 30 Leopard2A4 and T-80U-style rubber screens upgraded to Kontakt-1ERA was displayed as Leopard2A4V.This is a Canadian Leopard 1A4 sighting that has been upgraded to Kontakt-2ERA following previous sightings in Ukraine.
Leopard 2 Archer
Finland has modernized the Marksman SPAAG car by replacing the original T-55AM chassis with the new Leopard2A4 chassis. The upgraded Marksman car was scheduled to begin service with the Finnish army in 2016. The new Leopard2 chassis significantly improves mobility both on-road and off-road compared to the old T-55AM chassis. The Leopard 2 chassis is larger and provides a more stable firing platform for the Marksman turret to operate.
Leopard 2 Imp
"Leopard2Improved" is a series of prototypes that were developed in 1988 and were used to test further enhancements beyond the Leopard2A4 model. After the concept phase, a component test bed (KVT, Komponentenversuchsträger) was built in 1989, followed by two unit trial vehicles (TVM, Truppenversuchsmuster). Leopard2 mainly focuses on improving armor protection, introducing wedge-shaped spaced add-on armor on the front of the turret, and hull and roof add-on armor, which significantly improves protection against hollow charge and kinetic energy threats. It deflects the penetrator outward and does not hit the hull or turret ring, so no shot traps are formed. The gun mantlet has been redesigned to accept new armor. In addition to improved armor protection, these tanks also included improved optics, navigation systems and electronics.
Following the first trial of the 2 TVM prototypes in Germany and the agreement of the user state of Leopard 2, the 2nd TVM prototype has been modified (it will be tvm2mod.Add-ons are the basis of the Leopard 2a5 model by removing some parts such as hull and roof armor. 1 Leopard2 improved version (TVM2), in Sweden against Leclerc and M1A2 Abrams, led to the adoption of the Stridsvagn122.
Leopard 2A5
The improved Leopard 2 was developed into the Leopard 2a5. It was enhanced by adding external add-on modules to the turret and replacing the turret's internal armor modules with newer and improved configurations. If the armor is penetrated, the interior received a spall liner to reduce debris. The sight of the commander was moved to a new position behind the hatch and received an independent thermal channel. The view of the gunner was moved to the roof of the turret, in contrast to the cavity of the front armor of the previous model. A hatch with a heavier sliding screwdriver was installed.
The hydraulic turret drive has been replaced by an all-electric system, which has improved reliability and crew safety, as well as weight savings. The gun braking system has been improved to prepare for the later installation of the new L/55 gun tube and to allow the firing of more powerful ammunition, such as the DM53APFSDS. The first A5 was handed over to the German Army Tank School in 1995, and in the 12th month of the same year began regular service at Panzerbataillon33.
Leopard2A5DK is a variant of leopard2A5, similar to leopard2A6, with some minor modifications used by the Danish army.
Strides Wagner 122
The Stridsvagn122 (aka Leopard2A5S and Leopard2 "Improved" A5SE) is a Swedish Army tank based on Leopard2Improved. 120 were manufactured, of which 91 were licensed in Sweden. Armor on the top and front of the turret has been enhanced, and command, control and fire control systems have been improved. Externally, it can be distinguished from the Leopard 2a5 by the French GALIX smoke dispenser, various storage bins and a much thicker crew hatch. The STRV122B+Evolution is a variant equipped with IBD Deisenroth's modular AMAP composite armor, with enhanced 360° protection against EFPs, Rpg, Ied and other threats. The width of 4 meters (13 feet) is maintained, but the weight increases by only 350 kilograms (770 pounds).
Leopard 2-140
In the early 1990s, Rheinmetall began developing a 140mm smooth-bore gun for use in future tank designs. The new gun was intended to counter the development of new Soviet tanks, especially since it was rumored that the next generation of Soviet main battle tanks would be armed with 135mm or 152mm guns. The new 140mm gun was part of the Leopard 2 modernization program, known as the Kws III, with a test launch of the new 140mm gun. The results showed that the penetration of the gun was high, and the initial speed was about 2,000 meters per second, which could increase further. However, the 140mm bullet was too heavy for the tank crew to handle effectively.
The KWS III upgrade was equipped with a new turret. This new turret was equipped with the planned 140mm gun and autoloader. With the introduction of the autoloader, the crew of the tank was reduced to three members, as a dedicated loader was no longer needed. The gun's 32 rounds of ammunition were stored separately from the crew in a large compartment that occupied the entire rear of the turret to increase crew survival in case of cock-off. The turntable-style turrets had guns offset to the left, as the autoloader laterally supplied ammunition to the tail of the gun. The turret was driven by electro-hydraulic drive and was equipped with an IFIS battlefield management system. The crew was to be protected by armored capsules, improving the ballistic protection of the hull. The planned protection level for the KWS III upgrade was to be equal to or higher than the Leopard 2A5.
A total of 650 Leopard2KWS III tanks were initially planned to be purchased. However, in 1995, the KWS III program was discontinued due to changes in the political environment.
Nevertheless, the development of the 140mm gun continued, and Rheinmetall coordinated with the British Royal Weapons Company and the French GIAT company. The 140mm gun was mounted on an old Leopard 19 prototype with a turret T2. A counterweight was added to the rear of the turret to balance the increased weight of the 140mm gun. The modified Leopard 2 was not equipped with any other KWS III upgrades other than the new gun. Actual fire tests showed that the 140mm gun had better penetration than the existing 120mm gun, but had poor handling characteristics. The lack of autoloaders on the prototype further hindered performance.
Leopard 2A6
The Leopard2A6 includes the addition of a Rheinmetall 120mm L/55 smooth cavity gun and other modifications. All German tank battalions of the "Crisis Intervention Unit" are equipped with A6. Canada purchased 20 Leopard 2a6 units from the Netherlands. These were delivered in 2007. In 2007, Portugal purchased 37 Leopard 2A6 units from the Netherlands and delivered them in 2008. In 2014/1, Finland purchased 100 L2A6S from the Netherlands, supplying munitions, simulators and spare parts for 10 years. The tanks were delivered in batches between 2015 and 2019.
Leopard2A6A1 is the command version of Leopard2A6, derived from the KWS I program. The vehicle contains additional radios (the amount, depending on the level of command) to correspond to the communication of the commander of the section, platoon, unit, company, squadron or battalion. For section readers, the vehicle is equipped with 1x SEM80 and 1x SEM90VHF radios. For platoon or unit commanders, the vehicle is fitted with 800m field telephone cable drums fitted at the rear of the vehicle along with 1x SEM80 and 1x SEM90VHF radios. For company, squadron or battalion commanders, the vehicle is equipped with 2x SEM80 or 1x SEM93 and 1x SEM90vhf radios and 800m field telephone cable drums.
The Leopard2A6M is a version of the 2A6 with enhanced mine protection under the chassis, with internal enhancements to improve crew survivability. In the summer of 2007, Canada borrowed 20 A6M aircraft from Germany for deployment to Afghanistan.
Leopard2Hel is a derivative of 2003 2A6 ordered by the Greek army."Hel" stands for "Hellenic". 170 vehicles were delivered between 2006 and 2009. A total of 140 were built in Greece by Elbow, which delivered the first unit in late 2006.
The Leopard 2a6m CAN is a Canadian version of the Leopard 2a6m, with significant changes to the distinctive black box attached to the rear of the turret, standoff slat armor, and more. The first tanks made up of this variant were 20 tanks loaned by the German Federal Army to increase the firepower and protection given to Canadian troops operating in southern Afghanistan. The tank on loan holds the German MG3 machine gun, while the former Dutch tank is also expected to hold the FN MAG machine gun, as it has in common with the Canadian C6GPMG.Variant of FN MAG.
The first 20 tanks were loaned, so initially it was not possible to install air conditioning units, only minimal changes were made. The crew will wear a cooling vest instead, and the electric drive on the turret generates less heat than the hydraulic drive on the old Leopard C2. While the loaned German tanks will be kept by the Canadian Army and may be further upgraded, the former Dutch Leopard2A6S will be changed to the German Leopard2A6M specification and will be used as the return of the loaned tanks. The Canadian Leopard 2 in Afghanistan was later equipped with a much-needed air conditioning unit in the scorching desert of Afghanistan and Saab's barracuda camouflage mat, which reduces the sun load by 50%.
Leopard2A6TR was a Turkish variant during the tank procurement project of the Turkish Army in 2000. The version was based on 2A6EX. The project was discontinued in favor of the development of the indigenous Altai (main battle tank).
Leopold 2
The Leopard2E is a derivative of the 2A6 with greater armor protection, developed under a joint production program between the Spanish and German defense industries. The program was developed in 1995 within the framework of cooperation determined between the Ministries of Defense of the two countries and also included the ceding of use by the period of 108Leopard2A4 from the German army to the Spanish army. The session will be extended until 2016, after which these tanks will become the sole property of the Spanish Army, as it was published in 2006, and then in 10 installments per year a total of 15,124,014 euros will be paid, and from 2006 will be given joint ownership of the Spaniards.
In 1998, the Spanish government agreed to build 219 Leopard 2e lines, 16 Leopard 2er (Buffalo) and 4 training vehicles on site. They chose Santa Barbara Sistemas as their main contractor. The program has a budget of 1,939.4 million euros and includes integrated logistics support, training courses for crew instructors and maintenance engineers, driving, turret, maintenance, aiming and shooting simulators. Delivery of the first batch began in 2004.
Leopard 2PL
The Leopard2PL is a modernized Polish version of the Leopard2A4, implemented in cooperation with Rheinmetall and the Polish Armament group (Polish: Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa, PGZ). The Leopard2PL MBT is primarily tasked with attacking, maintaining territory and supporting mechanized and electrified subdivision with an on-board weapon system in all day and night weather conditions. The main upgrades, when compared to the Leopard 2a4, include the modernization of the commander and gunner's field of view, additional ballistic modules of the turret and a new electrical system of hydraulic stabilization systems.
The upgrade includes a new commander control and monitoring system, the installation of an auxiliary power unit (APU), a new turret storage compartment for crew equipment, and a customized tow truck due to the increased weight of the new type of upgraded tank. The upgraded 2PL version is a service with Polish land forces. Of the 128 Leopard2A4S from the first (14) and second (24) batches, 24 were upgraded to the Leopard2PL standard. The rest will be upgraded to the 2PLM1 standard.
Leopard 2PSO
The new Leopard2PSO (Peace Support Operations) variant is designed specifically for urban wars encountered in peacekeeping operations with increasing frequency. The Leopard2PSO features more effective all-purpose protection, secondary weapon stations, improved reconnaissance capabilities, obstacle clearance blades (OCB), shorter gun barrel for maneuvering on city streets at the expense of shooting range, non-lethal armament, close range surveillance capability via camera system, searchlights, and built-in non-wide open areas to improve patience and maneuverability. It also features further changes in These features are similar to the Tank City Survival Kit for the American M1A2 Abrams.
Leopard 2A7
The Leopard2A7 vehicle is not intended to be optimized for combat in urban terrain, so it is fundamentally different from the kmw variant, the 2A7+ (see below). A total of 20 vehicles were provided for the modification. This includes the former Dutch A6NL model returned from Canada to Germany. The original upgrade to the A6M has been extended in collaboration with Canada, including the Leopard2A6M-HEL series crew room cooling system, a new 12kW auxiliary power supply unit based on the Steyr Motors M20TCA UI engine, the Saab Barracuda Mobile Camouflage System (MCS) with Heat-Transfer Reduction (HTR CoolCam) system, and the field-mounted engine. These include the Battle Management and information System (IFIS: Integriertes Führungs), which has been proven in the pilot trials.- und Informationssystem), optimization of ultracapacitors and on-board networks in chassis and turrets, SOTAS IP digital intercom system, updating of fire extinguishing systems in crew compartments, and more.
The weapon system is adapted to fire his ammunition. It is fitted for, with no, additional passive side protection armor. The first Leopard2A7 was handed over to the German army in Munich in 2014-12. For the tank Battalion 203 14 vehicles were produced, 4 went to the training center of the Armored Corps, 1 went to the technical school of the land system and the Army technical school. The last tank remains as a reference vehicle for the KMW.
The Danish army received the first Leopard 2A5 main battle tank upgraded in Germany from the Leopard 2A7DK version at the Dragoons barracks in Holstebro. By 2022 the Danish army will receive a total of 44 Leopard 2A7 vehicles.
Simon T. Wesman, Senior Research Fellow at SIPRI's Arms Transfer and Military Spending program, said that information from the United Nations Register of Conventional Weapons in 2016 showed that part of Leopard 2A7 had been transferred to Singapore since 2014. SIPRI reported that the Singapore Military may have acquired between 2016 and 2019 a total of 45 Leopard 2A7 units, but Singapore's Ministry of Defence denied that it had acquired the 2A7 version, which is believed to have probably minimized the unrest of its neighbors.
In 2023/2, Norway ordered the delivery of 54 Leopard2A7 tanks from 2026, with an additional option of 18 vehicles if necessary. This order was later changed to the newly designated sub-metamorphism of 2A8NOR2A8.
Leopard 2A7+
The Leopard2A7+ first opened to the public in 2010 and featured the label "developed by KMW – tested and certified by the German Ministry of Defence." The Leopard2A7+ has been tested by the German Federal Army under the name UrbOp (urban operations).
The Leopard2A7+ is designed to work with both low-strength and high-strength competition. Modular armor enhances the tank's defenses. Front protection is improved with dual turret and hull front kits, while 360° protection against RPGs and mine protection increase the viability of the tank in urban operations. Modular armored system components were first used in Canada in Afghanistan. It can fire programmable high explosive munitions. The MG3 mounted on the turret was replaced by a stabilized FLW200 remotely controlled weapon station. Mobility, sustainability and situational awareness have also improved.
In 2018/12, Hungary ordered 44 of the 2A7+s, making it the 2nd operator of the modified version after Qatar.
Leopard 2A8
To replace the 18Leopard2A6 tanks handed over to the Ukrainian army, the German Ministry of Defense plans to purchase at least a batch of 18Leopard2A8 tanks (the plan must be approved by the German Parliament, since the amount of hundreds of contracts exceeds 2500 million euros).
The Italian government confirmed at the parliamentary auditions that Italy plans to purchase 250 Leopard 2A8 tanks over the period 2023-2025.
The Leopard2A8 is based on the current Leopard2A7HU production model, but features additional improvements.Among them is an all-round situational awareness system with Trophy AP integration and sensor fusion capabilities.
The Dutch MoD plans to procure up to 18 Leopard2A6 tanks in addition to the leased 52 Leopard2A8 tanks. This planned acquisition is part of the country's efforts to rebuild its military after severe budget cuts in the 21st century.
and leopard 2a8.
The Norwegian Army's order for 54Leopard2A7NOS has been changed to a new 6A8NOR variant by mid-2023. Due to various changes and changes in Norway, it was necessary to rename the original 2A7NO to a unique new 2A8NOR variant. Unlike the 2A8 in Germany, this sub-variant integrates the Kongsberg IC/CORTEX BATTLEFIELD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM designed and manufactured in Norway with the PROTECTOR RWS.
