Z37, a Type 1936A (Mob) destroyer built for the German Navy during World War II, was completed in 1942 and spent most of her short career in France, where she participated in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay in late 1943 before being struck by destroyer Z32 in early 1944. After being towed back to port, the German Navy determined that Z37 was too badly damaged to repair and disarmed the ship. Decommissioned later that year, she was dismantled by her crew and scrapped by the French in 1949.
Design and Description
The Type 1936A (Mob) destroyer was slightly larger and heavier armed than its predecessor, the Type 1936A. It was 127 meters (416 feet 8 inches) long and 121.9 meters (399 feet 11 inches) at the draft line. The beam was 12 meters (39 feet 4 inches) and the maximum draft was 4.62 meters (15 feet 2 inches). Two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, used steam supplied by six Wagner water tube boilers to produce 70,000 PS ( 51,000 kW; 69,000 shp) was designed to be generated. The design speed was 36 knots (67 km/h), but maximum speed was 35.5 knots (65.7 km/h).The 1936A (Mob) class destroyer had enough fuel oil to produce a range of 2,239 nautical miles (4,147 km; 2,577 miles) at 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph) The ship was equipped with a Her crew consisted of 11 to 15 officers and 305 to 21 enlisted men, with an additional four officers and 19 enlisted men when serving as fleet flagship.
The armament of the Type 1936A (mob) ships consisted of five 15 cm TbtsK C/36 guns mounted in a series turret forward and three in a single turret with gun shield aft of the main superstructure. Antiaircraft armament varied, with the Z37 having four 3.7cm Flak M42 guns in a pair of linked turrets next to the rear funnel and seven 2cm C/38 guns in one quadruple turret and three single turrets. It was equipped with two 53.3 cm torpedo tubes. Each rack was equipped with a pair of loading torpedoes. Aft deck was equipped with a mine track that could carry up to 60 mines. a passive underwater listening device called "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) was installed to detect submarines. an S-Gerät sonar was probably also installed. the Z37 was equipped with a FuMO 21 or FuMO 24 radar on the bridge.
Modifications
From early 1943 onward, the forward single 2cm gun was replaced by a quadruple 2cm gun. After her commissioning, she was equipped with the FuMB Metox radar detector.
Commissioning History
Z37 was ordered from Oderwerke Stettin as a Type 1938B destroyer on June 26, 1939, but the German Navy cancelled the order in September 1939 and reordered her as a Type 1936A (Mob) destroyer on September 19, 1939 from Germaniawerft under yard number G627 The order was cancelled in September 1939. The ship was broken ground on January 2, 1940 at Germaniawerft's Kiel shipyard and launched on February 24, 1941. Construction was delayed due to lack of manpower and materials, and Z37 was not commissioned until July 16, 1942.
On January 23, 1943, Z37 headed for Norway from the Baltic Sea as part of the escort of the battleship Scharnhorst and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, but was spotted by British aircraft and the operation was aborted. transferred to the French Atlantic coast via the English Channel. Despite attacks by British coastal guns and motor torpedo boats, the convoy was able to pass through the Strait of Dover unscathed, but Z37 ran aground at Le Havre on 6 March and damaged her starboard propeller, which was under repair until 18 March. On March 28, Z37, as one of four destroyers, provided a distant escort for the Italian blockade ship Himalaya leaving Bordeaux for the Far East; nine torpedo boats provided close escort, but the unit was spotted by a British air reconnaissance party and turned back On March 30, Z37, along with destroyers Z23, Z24, and Z32, was sent to intercept the incoming blockade runner Pietro Orseolo, and sailed out to intercept it. A heavy British air attack was repulsed, but Pietro Orseolo was damaged by a torpedo from the American submarine Shad before reaching safety at the mouth of the Gironde River on April 2; on April 9, Z37 sailed again to cover the breakaway in the Himalayas, but this too was frustrated by a British air attack.
On December 24, 1943, six destroyers of the 8th Destroyer Group (Z37, Z23, Z24, Z27, and ZH1) and the 4th Torpedo Boat Group (six torpedo boats) sailed to intercept the blockade ship Osorno, which they encountered on December 25. Despite heavy air attack, they succeeded in escorting Osorno to the Gironde, but Osorno hit a submerged wreck and had to be beached to save her cargo; on December 26, the 8th Destroyer Group (except ZH1), including Z37, and the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, including Alsterufer again set sail to intercept the ship. Unbeknownst to the Germans, Alsterhofer was attacked and set ablaze by B-24 Liberator bombers of Royal Air Force Squadron 311 (Czechoslovakia) on December 27 and abandoned by her crew; around noon on December 28, British cruisers Glasgow, which was patrolling the Bay of Biscay, and Enterprise encountered German destroyers and torpedo boats trying to intercept the blockade runners, resulting in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay. With heavy seas, the Germans were unable to demonstrate their theoretical advantage in speed and firepower, and destroyer Z27 and torpedo boats T25 and T27 were sunk; Z37 fired six torpedoes at the British cruisers, all missing; the destroyer Z37 was destroyed by the British, and the torpedo boats T25 and T27 were destroyed by the German destroyers.
On January 30, 1944, Z37, along with Z23 and Z32, collided with Z32 during exercises in the southern Bay of Biscay; one of Z37's torpedoes exploded, causing a fire, and some anti-aircraft ammunition exploded, causing extensive flooding. She was towed to Bordeaux, but was deemed too damaged to repair, her guns were removed to reinforce coastal defenses in the Gironde estuary, and her crew deployed as ground troops; she was decommissioned on 24 August and subsequently dismantled. The wreck was dismantled in 1949.
