Z28 was one of 15 Type 1936A destroyers built for the German Navy during World War II. Built as a fleet commander with fewer guns than her sisters, she was completed in 1941. During her first few years she was engaged in escorting convoys and minesweeping in Norwegian waters. z28 ran aground in early 1943 and spent the rest of the year making repairs. she returned to Norway briefly in early 1944, but was soon transferred to the Baltic Sea to support mine laying operations in the Gulf of Finland. she was dedicated to this duty until July Z28 remained dedicated to this task until July, when she began escorting German cruisers bombarding Soviet forces on land, in addition to German convoys evacuating people from Finland and the Baltic States.
Z28 also shelled Soviet positions on numerous occasions until she was damaged by a bomb during one such mission in October. Repairs took until February 1945, and not long after she was sunk in port by British bombers on March 6, resulting in many casualties.
Design and Outline
The Z28 was 127 meters (416 feet 8 inches) long with a draft line length of 121.90 meters (399 feet 11 inches). The ship was 12 meters (39 feet 4 inches) wide, with a maximum draft of 4.38 meters (14 feet 4 inches). Two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, used steam supplied by six Wagner water tube boilers to produce 70,000 PS (51,000 The Z28 was designed to generate 70,000 PS (51,000 kW; 69,000 shp) and achieve a design speed of 36 knots (67 km/h; 41 mph) using steam supplied by six Wagner water-tube boilers. She had a cruising range of 2,900 nautical miles (5,400 km, 3,300 miles). The crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors.
The Z28 carried four 15cm TbtsK C/36 guns mounted in single guns with gun shields, two on top of each other at the front and rear of the superstructure. To accommodate the fleet commander and his staff, one gun was relocated from the top of the aft superstructure to the top forward, and the aft superstructure was enlarged. Antiaircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C/30 guns mounted in pairs next to the rear funnel and six 2 cm C/30 guns mounted singly; the Type 36A carried two 53.3 cm torpedo tubes above water. Each rack was equipped with a pair of loaded torpedoes. The aft deck was equipped with a mine rail capable of carrying up to 60 mines. a passive underwater listening device called a "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) was fitted to detect submarines. a S-Gerät sonar was probably also fitted. the ship was also equipped with a "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät), which was a submarine listening device for the detection of submarines. A FuMO 24/25 radar was fitted above the bridge.
Alterations.
Between 1942 and 1943, the Z28's anti-aircraft armament was increased to 10 each of 3.7 cm and 2 cm guns; between 1944 and 1945, the aft searchlight was replaced by a FuMO 63 Hohenziel radar.
Commissioning History
Z28 was ordered from AG Weser (Deschimag) on 23 April 1938; she was broken ground on 30 November 1939 at the Bremen shipyard in Deschimag under yard number W962, launched on 20 August 1940, and commissioned on 9 August 1941. Her first commander was Lieutenant Colonel Hans Erdmenger, and from late 1941 to early 1942 she was based in Aarhus, Denmark, patrolling Skagerrak and Kattegat.
In April, she was transferred to Norway, where she escorted convoys. With her sister ship Z30 and two torpedo boats, she escorted the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer and the supply oiler Ditmarschen to Narvik on May 9; Z28 participated in the prelude to Operation Resselsprung, an attempt to intercept Convoy PQ 17 in July. At Narvik, Admiral Scheer and the Lützow sisters formed one group with Z28 and her four sisters, while the battleship Tirpitz and Admiral Hipper formed another group. On their way to rendezvous at Alta Fjord, three destroyers escorting Lützow and Tirpitz ran aground, forcing the entire group to abandon the operation; from 24 to 28 September, Admiral Hipper, together with sisters Z23, Z29, and Z30, participated in Operation Zarin, a mine sweeping operation off Nova Yazemlya Island. On 1 October, Z28 escorted Admiral Hipper from Alta Fjord to Bogen Bay, and on the 24th escorted Admirals Tirpitz and Scheer to Trondheim. She then proceeded to Kiel, Germany, to begin refit.
In early March 1943, she was one of the escorts of the battleship Scharnhorst to the Gulf of Borgen, and the only one not damaged by the weather; on 2 April, while sailing with destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen from Alterfjord to Halstad, Z28 ran aground. She headed for Trondheim for repairs, but was slightly damaged in an air raid on Trondheim's docks on July 24. She then returned to the Desimag shipyard in Bremen for complete repairs; based at Kristiansand, Norway, on anti-smuggling patrols since January 7, 1944, now assigned to Destroyer Squadron 6; on February 12-13, Z28 and two other destroyers laid a minefield at Skagerrak; Z 28 arrived at Reval, Estonia, on February 21. The convoy was initially tasked with escorting convoys between Libau and Reval, Latvia, and on March 12 laid the first minefield in Narva Bay while bombarding Soviet positions on the eastern shore of Narva Bay; until July, the convoy was primarily assigned to mine-sweeping duties. In preparation for Operation Tanne West (an operation to occupy Åland in the event of Finland's surrender), the flotilla escorted Lützow to the island of Utö on June 28, but the operation was cancelled and the ship returned to port.
On July 30 and August 1, Z28 and three other destroyers sailed to the Gulf of Riga to bombard Soviet positions inland; on August 5, they escorted the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen to the Estonian island of Osel and to engage targets in Latvia from August 19 to 20; Z28 and destroyer Z36 were sent on September 16, escorted MV Monte Rosa with refugees from Baltishport, Estonia, to Gotenhafen, Germany. Four days later, the ship assisted in the evacuation of 23,172 people from Reval during the advance of Soviet troops. The next day, together with destroyer Z25, she transported 370 people from Baltishport to Libau; on August 22, she escorted a ship carrying evacuees from the Åland Sea to Gottenhafen; on October 10, Z28 resumed shore bombardment duties, attacking targets in Memel on the same and 23rd; on the 22nd and 24th They engaged Soviet positions at Swolbe on the Estonian island of Saaremaa. During the latter operation, the ship was damaged by Soviet aircraft, killing nine crewmen and wounding many others. Repairs were completed on February 25, 1945, and two days later Z28 escorted the ocean liner "Deutschland" from Gotenhafen to Sassnitz to evacuate Germans from the Polish corridor as part of Operation Hannibal Repeating this mission on March 4, two days later, the latter port was bombed by the Royal Air Force, two bombs hit the ship in mid-ship, and she sank with heavy casualties.
