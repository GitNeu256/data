Once upon a time, and I do mean once upon a time, "the state was the state," there was no state. The state's origins go back to colonial times. The American Indians had no state because they were not recognized as a nationality. The British, who made their initial entry into the New World by force, had no state eitherâ€”after all, they were not recognized as nation-states. After independence, the United States recognized both the Indians and the British as nations and the Indians as states. As to the Indians, Washington, Adams and Adams had no more authority to rule the colonies than Washington, Adams and Jefferson had to rule New York, Massachusetts and Virginia.
