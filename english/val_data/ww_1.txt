World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. Contemporaneously described as "the war to end all wars", it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, making it one of the largest wars in history. Over 16 million people died, including 9.7 million Europeans, and an additional 7.9 million were wounded.
The war began after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife Sophie, by Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian nationalist on 28 June 1914. Serbia's allies, Russia and France, and Austria-Hungary's ally, Germany, were drawn into the conflict. Within weeks, the major powers were at war and the conflict had expanded into a global war.
The war was fought between two opposing alliances: the Triple Entente (Britain, France, and Russia) and the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy). The war was fought on land, sea, and in the air. New technologies, such as tanks, airplanes, and chemical weapons, were used for the first time in warfare.
The war ended with the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918. The war had a profound impact on the world. It led to the collapse of four empires: the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian empires. It also led to the creation of new countries, such as Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Poland. The war also led to the rise of communism in Russia and the establishment of the Soviet Union.
