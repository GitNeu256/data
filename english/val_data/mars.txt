Mars in astronomy is the fourth planet from the Sun, with an orbit second only to that of the Earth.
Physical Characteristics
Mars has a striking red appearance and is twice as bright as the brightest star, Sirius. At 4,200 miles (6,800 km) in diameter, Mars is a little more than half the size of Earth and has only 11% of Earth's mass. Mars' atmosphere is composed primarily of carbon dioxide, but also contains nitrogen and argon. The temperature difference between day and night on Mars ranges from about 80째F (27째C) during the day to -100째F (-73째C) at night, which is extreme due to the thin atmosphere.
Surface Features
The linear pattern first studied in detail by G.V. Schiaparelli in 1877 was called canali, which means "groove" or "furrow" in Italian. Percival Lowell, a leading Mars researcher at the time, considered these "canals" to be the work of intelligent life, sparking a long controversy. Under the best observational conditions, however, they appear to be little more than small, unconnected landforms. The vast majority of the surface area of Mars is a vast desert with a dull red or orange color. This color is probably due to the various oxides in the surface composition, especially iron oxides. About one-quarter to one-third of the surface consists of dark regions whose nature has not yet been determined. Immediately after perihelion, Mars could be hit by a planet-wide dust storm that would obscure surface details.
Photographs taken by the Mars Mariner 4 spacecraft show several large craters on the Martian surface, similar to those on the Moon; in 1971, the Mariner 9 spacecraft discovered a huge canyon, Valles Marineris. The canyon, which completely dwarfs Arizona's Grand Canyon, spans 4,000 km and is 125 miles (200 km) wide and 2 miles (3 km) deep in some places. Mars also has giant volcanoes, including the largest in the solar system, Olympus Mons (about 370 miles (600 km) in diameter and 16 miles (26 km) high), and lava plains. 1976, the Viking spacecraft landed on Mars to investigate Crisis and Utopia. It recorded desert environments with reddish surfaces and reddish atmospheres. These experiments analyzed soil samples for signs of microorganisms and other life forms, but found none. 1997 Mars Pathfinder landed on Mars and sent the small rover Sojourner to take soil samples and photographs. 1997 Mars reached Mars. Mars Global Surveyor also systematically mapped the surface of Mars. The European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft orbited Mars in late 2003 and sent the Beagle 2 lander to the Martian surface, but no contact with the lander was established. The U.S. rovers Spirit and Opportunity successfully landed in early 2004.
Analysis of satellite data indicates that there does not appear to be active plate tectonics on Mars today. Because of the lack of plate motion, sub-crustal hotspots are in a constant position relative to the surface, which, along with the low gravity of the surface, may explain the giant volcanoes. However, there is no evidence of current volcanic activity. There are traces of erosion by floods and small rivers. The possibility of identifying rounded pebbles and boulders on the surface and sockets and pebbles in some rocks suggests conglomerates formed by running water in the warm past, about 2 to 4 billion years ago, when liquid water was stable, there was water on the surface, and perhaps even large lakes and oceans. The probe identified minerals that formed only when liquid water was present. There is also evidence of flooding that may be the result of water being released from aquifers deep underground millions of years ago; data from the Mars Odyssey rover, which began in 2002, suggests the presence of water in sand dunes in the northern hemisphere.
Seasonal Changes
Because Mars' axis of rotation is tilted about 25 degrees relative to its orbital plane, Mars has seasons similar to those on Earth. One of the most noticeable seasonal changes is the growth and shrinkage of the white areas near the poles known as the polar caps. These polar caps are composed of water ice and dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide). In the Martian summer, the polar caps of that hemisphere shrink and the dark areas become darker, and in the winter the polar caps grow again and the dark areas become lighter. The seasonal part of the ice cap is dry ice.
Astronomical Features
The average distance of Mars from the sun is about 141 million miles (228 million km), and its orbital period is about twice that of the earth, about 687 days. When the Sun, Earth, and Mars are aligned (i.e., in opposition) and Mars is closest to the Sun (perihelion), Mars' distance from the Earth is about 35 million miles (56 million km). When Mars is farthest from the sun (aphelion), its distance from the earth is about 63 million miles (101 million km). Its rotation period is about 24 hours 37 minutes, slightly longer than one day on Earth.
Satellites of Mars
Mars has two satellites, discovered by Asaph Hall in 1877. The innermost satellite, Phobos, is about 11 km in diameter and orbits Mars with a period much shorter than the Martian rotation period (7 hours 39 minutes). The outer satellite Deimos is about 4 miles (6 km) in diameter.
