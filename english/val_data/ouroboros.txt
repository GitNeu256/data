 The ouroboros entered the Western tradition through ancient Egyptian iconography and the Greek magic tradition. It was adopted as a symbol in Gnosticism and Hermeticism and used especially in alchemy. Some snakes, such as the rat snake, are known to eat themselves.
Name and Interpretation
The word ouroboros comes from the ancient Greek οὐροβόρος, from οὐρά oura "tail" and -βορός -boros "to eat."
The ouroboros is often interpreted as a symbol of eternal rebirth, or the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. A snake biting its own tail is a symbol of fertility in some religions. The tail is a phallic symbol and the mouth a yonic or womb-like symbol.
Historical Representations
Ancient Egypt
One of the earliest ouroboros motifs is found in the ancient Egyptian funerary text "The Mysterious Book of the Netherworld" in Tutankhamun's tomb KV62, dated to the 14th century BC. This text concerns Ra's behavior in the netherworld and his union with Osiris. The Ouroboros is depicted twice, one with its tail in its mouth, surrounding the head and upper chest, and the other surrounding the legs of a larger figure. Both serpents are manifestations of Mehen, the patron deity of Ra, who in other funerary texts travels through the underworld. The entire figure of the god represents the beginning and end of time.
The Ouroboros appears in other Egyptian sources and, like many Egyptian snake gods, represents the formless disorder that surrounds an ordered world and is involved in the cyclical rebirth of that world. The symbol persisted from Egyptian times to Roman times and was frequently depicted on magical amulets, sometimes combined with other magical emblems. The fourth-century A.D. Latin annotator Servius knew of the symbol's use in Egypt and noted that the serpent biting its tail represented the cyclical nature of the year.
Gnosticism and Alchemy
In Gnosticism, the snake biting its tail symbolized eternity and the soul of the world. The Gnostic Pistis Sophia (ca. 400 A.D.) describes the ouroboros as a dragon composed of 12 parts that surrounds the world with its tail in its mouth.
The famous picture of the Ouroboros in an early alchemical book, Cleopatra's Chrysopoeia (Κλεοπάτρας χρυσοποιία), probably from 3rd century Alexandria, was first known in a 10th century manuscript. Its black and white halves may represent a Gnostic duality of being, analogous to the Taoist yin-yang symbol. The Chrysopoea Ouroboros of the alchemist Cleopatra is one of the earliest images of the Ouroboros to be associated with the legendary work of the alchemists, the Philosopher's Stone.
In the Aurora Consurgens, a 15th century alchemical manuscript, the Ouroboros is depicted mixed with symbols of the sun, moon, and mercury.
The World Serpent in Mythology
In Norse mythology, Ouroboros appears as the serpent Jormungandr, one of the three children of Loki and Angleboda, who grew so large that he encircled the world and could grasp its tail with his teeth.In Ragnarssona þáttr and other legends of Ragnar Lodbrok, King Hero of the Gate gave his daughter After giving Fiora Taung-Hart a small rindworm, the rindworm grows into a large serpent that surrounds her daughter's bower and bites its tail. The serpent is killed by Ragnar Lodbrok, and Ragnar marries Físora. Ragnar later had a son with another woman named Kraka, who was born with the image of a white snake in one eye. This snake surrounded the iris and bit the tail, so the son was named Serpent's Eye. A common belief among the indigenous peoples of the tropical lowlands of South America is that the waters at the edge of the world disk are surrounded by snakes (often anacondas) that bite their own tails.
The Ouroboros shares some characteristics with the biblical Leviathan. According to the Zohar, the Leviathan is a peculiar creature without a mate, "its tail is in its mouth," and Rashi in Baba Batra 74b describes it as "engulfing and enveloping the whole world." This identification seems to date back to a 6th- and 7th-century poem by Kalir.
Connection to Indian Thought
In the Aitareya Brahmana, a Vedic text from the early first millennium B.C., the nature of Vedic rituals is compared to "a snake biting its own tail."
The symbolism of the ouroboros has been used to describe the kundalini. According to the medieval Yoga Kundalini Upanishad, "The divine power, the kundalini, shines like a young lotus stalk, curled up on itself, like a snake, with its tail in its mouth, half asleep at the base of the body" (1.82).
Storl (2004) also mentions the image of the Ouroboros in relation to the "cycle of reincarnation."

Jungian Psychology
The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung considered the Ouroboros to be the archetype and basic mandala of alchemy. Jung also defined the relationship between the Ouroboros and alchemy: Carl Jung, Collected Works, Vol. 513.
The alchemists, who in their own way knew more about the nature of the individuation process than we moderns do, expressed this paradox in the symbol of the ouroboros, the snake that eats its own tail. It has been said that the ouroboros has the meaning of infinity and wholeness. The ancient image of the ouroboros contains the idea of devouring and circulating oneself. It was obvious to the brightest alchemists that the primordial substance of alchemy was the human being itself. The ouroboros is a dramatic symbol of the integration and assimilation of opposites, or shadows. This "feedback" process is at the same time a symbol of immortality. For the Ouroboros is said to kill itself, bring itself back to life, fertilize itself, and give birth to itself. The Ouroboros symbolizes the "One" that is born from the clash of opposites, and thus the Ouroboros undoubtedly constitutes the secret of the "primordial materia" that originates in the human unconscious.
The Jungian psychologist Erich Neumann wrote that the dream is a representation of the "dawn state," the preliminary stage of the ego, and depicts the undifferentiated infantile experience of humanity and the individual child.
Kekule's Dream
German organic chemist August Kekule describes the moment he understood the structure of benzene after a vision of the Ouroboros
I was sitting down and writing in my textbook. I turned my chair to the fire and dozed off. But the work was not going on, and my thoughts had shifted elsewhere. This time a small group was discreetly behind me. Having seen this scene so many times, my eyes became sharper, able to discern larger structures of various shapes and sizes. But look. What is that thing? One of the snakes grabbed its own tail and its form whirled mockingly before my eyes. I awoke as if a bolt of lightning had struck me. And again, I spent the rest of the night working out the results of my hypothesis.
Cosmos.
Martin Rees used the Ouroboros to describe the various scales of the universe, from 10-20 cm (elementary particles) at the tail end to 1025 cm (supergalactic systems) at the top. Rees emphasized the "intimate connection between the micro-world and the universe symbolized by the Ouroboros," or the meeting of the tail and the head to complete the circle.
Cybernetics.
In Design for the Brain (1952), W. Ross Ashby applied ideas from biology to his own work as a psychiatrist. Palmar contextualized his practice as an artist by applying the principles of cybernetic ouroboros to musical improvisation.
 He also refers to "self-indication," a logical process notation developed by Francisco Varela to analyze and explain self-generating autonomous systems and the "mysteries of being alive." Reichel describes this as follows
an abstract conception of a system, the structure of which is maintained through and through the self-production of that structure. In Kaufman's words, it is "the symbol of the insect Ouroboros from ancient mythology embedded in a mathematical, non-numerical calculus.
This calculus is derived from the confluence of feedback cybernetic logic, the sub-discipline of autopoiesis developed by Varela and Umberto Maturana, and George Spencer Brown's calculus of indications. In another related biological application, Rosen uses the logic of autopoiesis, the logic of feedback, and George Spencer Brown's logic of indications:
Rosen's insight that metabolism is merely a mapping is noteworthy. It turns out that the solution to the self-referential Ouroboros equation f(f) = f for an unknown function f, which may be too rough for biologists, shows how to recursively construct the solution by a limiting process.
Second-order cybernetics (cybernetics of cybernetics) applies the principle of self-referentiality, i.e., the participation of the observer in the observed, to explore the involvement of the observer.
Genus of Armadillo Lizards
The genus name of the armadillo lizard, Ouroborus cataphractus, is derived from the animal's defensive posture, in which it curls up and holds its own tail in its mouth.
Iberian culture
The medium-sized European hake, called pescadilla in Spanish and pescada in Portuguese, often appears with its tail in its mouth. In Spanish, it is called pescadilla de rosca ("torus hake"); Uma pescadinha de rabo na boca "little merluza with tail in mouth"; La pescadilla que se muerde la cola "merluza biting tail". are both Portuguese and Spanish proverbs that describe a circular logic or vicious circle.
