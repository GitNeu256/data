Google LLC is an American multinational technology company focused on artificial intelligence, online advertising, search engine technology, cloud computing, computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, and consumer electronics. It has been called "the world's most powerful company" and "one of the world's most valuable brands" because of its market dominance, data collection capabilities, and technological superiority in the field of artificial intelligence. Google's parent company, Alphabet, is one of the five big tech companies, along with Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.
Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were doctoral students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of the company's listed shares and control 56% of shareholder voting rights through super-voting shares. The company completed its initial public offering (IPO) in 2004; in 2015, Google was restructured as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet, Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is the holding company for Alphabet's Internet assets and profits. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, succeeding Larry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet; on December 3, 2019, Pichai was also appointed CEO of Alphabet.
The company has grown rapidly since then, offering numerous products and services in addition to Google Search, many of which dominate the market. These products include email (Gmail), navigation (Waze & Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web browsing (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android ), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), video calling (Translate) for a wide range of use cases, photo storage (Photos), video calling (Meet), smart home (Nest) Smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch & Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), artificial intelligence (Google Assistant & Bard), machine learning APIs ( TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), etc. Discontinued Google products include games (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.

Google and YouTube are the most visited websites in the world, followed by Facebook and X (formerly Twitter). Google also offers search engines, map and navigation applications, email providers, office suites, video sharing platforms, photo and cloud storage providers, mobile operating systems, web browsers, ML frameworks, and AI virtual assistant providers. On lists of most valuable brands, Google is ranked #2 by Forbes and #4 by Interbrand. The company has received significant criticism related to privacy issues, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust, and abuse of its monopoly position.
History
Early Years
Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The project initially included an unofficial "third founder," Scott Hassan. Scott Hassan was the first lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google search engine, but left before Google was officially incorporated as a company. Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded Willow Garage, Inc. in 2006.
While traditional search engines rank results by counting how many times a search term appears on a page, they theorized about a better system that analyzes relationships between websites. The algorithm, called Page Rank, determined the relevance of a website by the number of pages and the importance of the pages linking to the original site. Paige shared her idea with Hassan, and Hassan began writing code to implement Paige's idea.
Paige and Brin initially nicknamed this new search engine "BackRub" because the system checks backlinks to estimate the importance of a site. Hassan and Alan Stellenberg were cited by Page and Brin as integral to Google's development. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper on the project in 1998, describing PageRank and an early prototype of the Google search engine. Héctor García-Molina and Jeff Ullman are also listed as contributors to the project; PageRank was influenced by similar page rank and site scoring algorithms previously used in RankDex, which was developed by Robin Li in 1996, Larry Page's PageRank patent contains citations to Li's earlier RankDex patent.
The name of the search engine is a misspelling of the word googol, a very large number written as 10100 (1 followed by 100 zeros), chosen to signify that the search engine is intended to provide a large amount of information.
Google initially received a $100,000 investment from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, in August 1998. This initial investment provided the motivation to incorporate the company to make the funds available. Page and Brin initially sought advice from David Cheriton. They knew that he had experience in entrepreneurship, as he had an office near Stanford University and had just sold Granite Systems, a company he co-founded, to Cisco for $220 million. David arranged a meeting with Page, Brin, and Granite co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. The meeting took place at 8:00 a.m. on the front porch of David's home in Palo Alto and had to be short because Andy had another meeting at 9:00 a.m. in Cisco, where he now worked after the acquisition. Later, David Cheriton joined him with a $250,000 investment.
Google received investment from two other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos and entrepreneur Ram Shriram. Page and Brin first sought funding and advice from Shriram, a venture capitalist, who invested $250,000 in Google in February 1998. Shriram knew Bezos because Amazon had acquired Jungle and Shriram was president there. It was also Shriram who told Bezos about Google. Bezos asked Shriram to meet with Google's founders, and six months after Shriram's investment, the two met when Bezos and his wife were on vacation in the Bay Area. Google's first round of funding had already officially closed, but Bezos' position as CEO of Amazon was enough to convince Page and Brin to extend the round and accept his investment.
Between these early investors, friends, and family, Google raised about $1 million, which allowed it to open its original store in Menlo Park, California. Craig Silverstein, a PhD student at Stanford University, was hired as the first employee.
After several small additional investments in late 1998 and early 1999, a new $25 million round of financing was announced on June 7, 1999, by major investors including venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital. Both firms had initially expressed reluctance to co-fund Google. However, Larry and Sergey insisted on receiving investment from both companies. Both venture firms eventually agreed to co-invest. They invested $5 million each, thanks to their belief in Google's great potential and through the intermediaries of earlier angel investors Ron Conway and Ram Shriram, who had contacts in the venture business.
Growth
In March 1999, Google moved its offices to Palo Alto, California, home to Silicon Valley technology startups. The following year, Google began selling ads related to search terms, something Page and Brin had initially opposed. To maintain a clean page design, ads were to be text-based only; in June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo, one of the most popular websites at the time.
In 2003, the company outgrew its other two locations and leased an office complex from Silicon Graphics at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway in Mountain View, California. The complex became known as the googolplex. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million. By then, the name "Google" had permeated everyday language, and the verb "googling" was added to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary: "to obtain information on the Internet using Google's search engine. The first time the verb was used on television was in an October 2002 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
Additionally, in 2001, Google's investors saw the need for a strong internal management team and agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as Google's Chairman and CEO. Eric was proposed by John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins. He had been trying for several months to find a CEO that Sergey and Larry would accept, but had rejected several candidates because he wanted to retain control of the company. Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital had even threatened to demand that Google immediately repay Sequoia's $12.5 million investment if it did not fulfill its verbal commitment to hire a CEO, which it had made during investment negotiations. Eric was not initially enthusiastic about joining Google either. At the time, Google's potential was not yet fully recognized, and he had been CEO at Novell, so he was preoccupied with his responsibilities. Upon joining the company, Eric demonstrated his commitment and agreed to purchase $1 million in Google preferred stock as a way to provide Google with the funding it needed.
Initial Public Offering
On August 19, 2004, Google became a publicly traded company through an initial public offering. At that time, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, through 2024. The company offered 19,605,052 shares at $85 per share. The shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, the underwriters of the transaction.The $1.67 billion sale took Google's market capitalization past $23 billion.
On November 13, 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock, and on March 11, 2008, Google acquired DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, transferring DoubleClick's valuable relationships with web publishers and advertising agencies to Google.
By 2011, Google was handling approximately 3 billion searches per day. To handle this workload, Google built 11 data centers around the world, each with thousands of servers. These data centers have enabled Google to handle its ever-changing workload more efficiently.
In May 2011, Google's monthly unique visitors topped 1 billion for the first time.
In May 2012, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion. The acquisition was also intended to give Google access to Motorola's vast patent portfolio of cell phone and wireless technology, protecting Google in the midst of ongoing patent disputes with other companies, primarily Apple and Microsoft, and allowing it to continue to offer Android freely.
2012 and Beyond
In June 2013, Google acquired Waze for $966 million; Waze will remain an independent entity, but its crowdsourced location platform and other social features were reportedly a valuable integration between Waze and Google's own mapping service, Google Maps It is said to have been a valuable integration between Waze and Google's own mapping service, Google Maps.
On September 19, 2013, Google announced the formation of a new company, Calico, led by Apple Chairman Arthur Levinson. In an official statement, Page explained that this "health and wellness" company would focus on "the challenges of aging and related diseases."
On January 26, 2014, Google announced that it had agreed to acquire Deep Mind Technologies, a privately held London-based artificial intelligence company. The technology news site Recode reported that the company had been acquired for $400 million, but sources were not disclosed. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the price. The Deepmind acquisition helps Google's recent growth in artificial intelligence and robotics; in 2015, Deepmind's Alpha Go became the first computer program to beat a top human professional at Go.
According to Interbrand's annual "Best Global Brands" report, Google was the second most valuable brand in the world (behind Apple Inc.) in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, with a valuation of $133 billion.
On August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests into a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc.

On August 8, 2017, after Google distributed a memo companywide claiming that bias and "Google's ideological echo chamber" were clouding its thinking on diversity and inclusion, and that discrimination as well as biological factors were responsible for the average woman being less interested than men in technical positions and fired employee James Damore. Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore of violating company policy by "promoting harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace," and Damore was fired immediately.
In 2018-2019, tensions between the company's leadership and employees escalated as staff protested company decisions in areas that were seen as revenue growth areas for the company, including internal sexual harassment, the censored Chinese search engine Dragonfly, and Project Maven, an artificial intelligence for military drones. On October 25, 2018, The New York Times published an exposé, "How Google Protected Andy Rubin, the 'Father of Android. The company subsequently announced that "48 employees have been fired in the past two years" for sexual misconduct.On November 1, 2018, more than 20,000 Google employees and contractors staged a global walkout to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment complaints.CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly supported the action. Later in 2019, some workers accused the company of retaliating against activists in the company.
On March 19, 2019, Google announced that it would enter the video game market and launch a cloud gaming platform called Google Stadia.
On June 3, 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice reported that it would investigate Google for antitrust violations. This led to an antitrust lawsuit in October 2020, alleging that the company abused its monopoly position in the search and search advertising markets.
In December 2019, former PayPal COO Bill Reddy was named Google's new head of commerce. Reddy's role will not directly involve Google Pay.
In April 2020, due to the COVID-19 craze, Google announced several cost-saving measures. Such measures included slowing hiring for the remainder of 2020 except in a few strategic areas, realigning the focus and pace of investments in areas such as data centers and machinery, and marketing and travel that were not essential to the business. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in most employees telecommuting, and its success was such that Google announced that it would permanently convert some jobs to telecommuting! 
Google's outages in 2020 were an August one that affected Google Drive and other services, a November one that affected YouTube, and a December one that affected Google's entire suite of applications All three times the service was restored within a few hours.
In 2021, the Alphabet Labor Union was founded, composed mainly of Google employees.

In March 2021, Google reportedly paid $20 million for Ubisoft's transplant at Google Stadium. Google spent "tens of millions of dollars" to get major publishers like Ubisoft and Take-Two to port some of their biggest games to stadia.
In April 2021, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google had implemented a multi-year program called "Project Bernanke," which used data from past ad bids to gain an advantage over competitors for advertising services. This was revealed in documents related to an antitrust lawsuit filed against Google by 10 U.S. states in December.
In September 2021, the Australian government announced plans to curtail Google's ability to sell targeted advertising, claiming that Google was monopolizing the market and harming publishers, advertisers, and consumers.
In 2022, Google began accepting requests to remove phone numbers, addresses, and e-mail addresses from search results. Until then, it had only accepted removal requests for sensitive data such as social security numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, personal signatures, and medical records. The new policy still allows Google to remove information from only certain search queries, but not from all search queries. It will not remove "broadly useful" content, such as news articles, or content that is already part of public records.
In May 2022, Google announced that it had acquired Raxium, a California-based startup company that develops and manufactures micro-LED display technology. Raxium will join Google's device services team to help develop micro-optics, monolithic integration, and system integration.
In early 2023, in response to the success of ChatGPT and concerns that Google was falling behind in the AI race, Google's senior management issued a "Code Red" directive to "incorporate generative AI in all of our most important products (those with over 1 billion users) within a few months" The company issued the "Code Red".
In early May 2023, Google announced plans to build two additional data centers in Ohio. These centers, to be built in Columbus and Lancaster, will power the company's tools, including AI technology. The said data hubs will be added to the centers already in operation near Columbus, bringing Google's total investment in Ohio to over $2 billion.

Search Engines
Google has indexed billions of web pages, allowing users to search for desired information using keywords and operators. google search is the dominant search engine with a 65.6% share of the US market, according to a November 2009 comScore market study. In May 2017, Google enabled a new "Personal" tab in Google Search, which allows users to search content within various Google Account services, such as Gmail email messages and Google Photos photos.
In 2002, Google launched Google News, an automated service that summarizes news articles from various websites. Google also hosts Google Books, a service that searches the text of books in its database and displays limited previews and, when authorized, the full text of books.
Google has expanded its search services to include shopping (originally launched in 2002 as Froogle), finance (launched in 2006), and airline tickets (launched in 2011).
Advertising
Google derives most of its revenue from advertising. This includes sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products on Google and YouTube, and licensing and service fees, including fees for use of Android and Google Cloud. 46% of this profit came from clicks (cost per click), which amounted to US$109,652 million in 2017. This includes three main methodologies: AdMob, AdSense (including AdSense for Content and AdSense for Search), and DoubleClick AdExchange.
In addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology from its acquisition of DoubleClick to predict user interests and target ads according to search context and user history.
In 2007, Google entered the emerging mobile advertising market with the launch of Adsense for Mobile.
Google Analytics allows website owners to track where and how their websites are being used, including examining the click-through rate of all links on a page. Google Ads can be placed on third-party websites through two programs: Google Ads allows advertisers to display their ads on Google's content network on a cost-per-click basis. Its sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these ads on their websites and earn money each time an ad is clicked. One criticism of this program is the potential for click fraud. Click fraud is when an individual or automated script clicks on an ad even though they are not interested in the product and the advertiser improperly pays Google. 2006 industry reports indicate that approximately 14-20% of clicks were fraudulent or invalid. Google Search Console (rebranded from Google Webmaster Tools in May 2015) allows webmasters to check website sitemaps, crawl rates, security issues, and optimize website visibility.

Corporate Performance
Stock Performance and Quarterly Earnings
Google's initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004; at the time of the IPO, the company sold 19,605,052 shares at $85 per share; the $1.67 billion sale brought Google's market capitalization to over $23 billion. The share price was strong after the IPO, hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007. The share price surge was driven primarily by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds. GOOG shares are divided into GOOG Class C shares and GOOGL Class A shares. The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols have referred to Google's holding company, Alphabet Inc. since Q4 2015.
In the third quarter of 2005, Google reported a 700% increase in profits, largely due to large corporations shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.
In 2006, advertising revenue was $10.492 billion, with only $112 million in licensing and other revenue; in 2011, 96% of Google's revenue came from advertising programs.
In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page said, "We finished 2012 with a strong quarter. Sales were up 36% year over year and 8% quarter over quarter. And for the first time last year, we achieved $50 billion in sales." - Not bad for an achievement achieved in just a decade and a half.
Google reported consolidated sales of $14.89 billion in the third quarter of 2013 in mid-October 2013, up 12% from the previous quarter. Google's Internet business accounted for $10.8 billion of this amount, and users clicked on more ads; by January 2014, Google's market capitalization had grown to $397 billion.
Tax Avoidance Strategies
Google employs a variety of tax avoidance strategies. Among the top technology companies in terms of revenue, Google pays the lowest taxes to the country of origin of its sales. between 2007 and 2010, Google saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shifting non-U.S. profits to Bermuda via Ireland and the Netherlands. This approach, for example, reduced the company's non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3%, compared to the usual 28% corporate tax rate in the U.K. For this reason, France reportedly investigated Google's transfer pricing taxation in 2012.
In 2020, Google announced that it had overhauled its controversial global tax structure and consolidated all intellectual property in the United States.
Google Vice President Matt Brittin testified before the U.K. House of Commons Accounts Committee that the U.K. sales team did not record sales and therefore paid no sales tax to the U.K. In January 2016, Google settled with the U.K. by paying £130 million in back taxes and future tax increases. 2017 , Google funneled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce taxes.
In 2013, Google ranked fifth in lobbying spending, up from 213th in 2003; in 2012, the company ranked second in campaign contributions in the technology and Internet sector.
Corporate Identity
The company name "Google" is derived from a misspelling of "googol". Page and Brin wrote in their first paper on PageRank, "We chose the system name Google because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100, and it fit our goal of building a very large search engine." The verb "google" was added to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006. From the beginning, Google's mission statement has been "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful," and its unofficial slogan is "Don't be evil." In October 2015, the motto associated with Alphabet's corporate code of conduct, "Do the right The phrase "Do the right thing" was adopted. The original motto was adopted verbatim into the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet.
The original Google logo was designed by Sergey Brin, and since 1998 Google has designed special temporary alternative logos to celebrate holidays, events, achievements, and people, which are then posted on its homepage. The first Google Doodle commemorated the 1998 Burning Man Festival. The doodle was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to let users know they were not present in case the server crashed. Subsequent Google doodles were designed by outside contractors, but Larry and Sergey commissioned then intern Dennis Hwang to design the logo for Bastille Day in 2000. Since then, Doodles have been planned and produced by a team of employees called "Doodlers.
Google has a tradition of making April Fool's jokes; the first one on April 1, 2000 was Google MentalPlex, which used mental powers to search the web. 2007, Google announced a free Internet service called TiSP (Toilet Internet Service Provider). a free Internet service it announced.
Google's service included Easter eggs such as Swedish chef "bork bork bork," Pig Latin, "hacker" or leetspeak, Elmer Fudd, pirate, and Klingon as language choices for the search engine. If you search for the word "anagram," meaning a rearrangement of letters to make another valid word from one word, Google's suggestion feature will show "Did you mean: nag a ram." in 2019 and beyond, Google will help engineers better plan and write technical documents running free online courses to learn how to. Workplace Culture
In Fortune magazine's "Best Companies to Work For" rankings, Google was ranked #1 in 2007, 2008, and 2012, and #4 in 2009 and 2010. In 2010, Google was also nominated as the world's most attractive employer for new graduates in Unversum Communications' Talent Acquisition Index. Google's corporate philosophy includes principles such as "You don't have to do evil to make money," "You don't have to wear a suit to be serious," and "Work should be rewarding and that rewarding should be fun."
As of September 30, 2020, Alphabet Inc. had 132,121 employees, more than 100,000 of whom work for Google. According to Google's 2020 Diversity Report, 32% of employees are women, 68% are men, and the majority of employees are white (51.7%) and Asian (41.9%). In technical positions, 23.6% were women and 26.7% were women in leadership roles.In addition to more than 100,000 full-time employees, Google used approximately 121,000 temporary and contract employees as of March 2019.
Google employees are hired based on a hierarchical system. Employees are divided into six tiers based on experience, ranging from "level 1 entry-level data center workers to level 6 managers and experienced engineers." As a motivational technique, Google has adopted a policy called "Innovation Time Off," in which Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them; Gmail, Google News, Orkut, Marissa Mayer, Google's vice president of search products and user experience until July 2012, said in a talk at Stanford University that half of the new products announced in late 2005 were the result of innovation time-off. were born out of the innovation time-off.
In 2005, articles in the New York Times and elsewhere began to suggest that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no-evil philosophy. To maintain Google's unique corporate culture, Google appointed a Chief Culture Officer to develop and maintain the corporate culture and work on ways to stay true to the core values that had been in place since the company's founding. Google has also faced allegations of sex and age discrimination from former employees. in 2013, a class action lawsuit was filed against several silicon valley companies, including Google, for alleged "no cold-calling" agreements that inhibited the hiring of high-tech employees. the lawsuit, filed on January 8, 2018 alleged that several employees and job applicants alleged that Google discriminated against a class defined by "conservative political views male gender and/or white or Asian race."
On January 25, 2020, the formation of Alpha Global, an international labor union of Google employees, was announced. This coalition consists of "13 different unions representing workers from 10 different countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland." The group is affiliated with the UNI Global Union, which represents some 20 million international workers from various unions and federations. The formation of the union is in response to persistent allegations of abuse and toxic workplace culture against Google employees. Google had previously been accused of monitoring and firing employees suspected of organizing unions; in 2021 court documents, Google was accused of launching an anti-union It was revealed that a campaign was underway to "convince them [employees] that unions suck.
Office Location
Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, is called the "Googleplex" because of the number googolplex and because the headquarters itself is a building complex. Internationally, Google has more than 78 offices in over 50 countries.
In 2006, Google moved into approximately 300,000 square feet (27,900 square meters) of office space at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. The office was designed and built specifically for Google and houses Google's largest advertising sales team.In 2010, Google acquired this headquarters building for approximately $1.9 billion.In March 2018, Google's parent company, Alphabet, purchased the nearby Chelsea Market Building for $2.4 billion. purchase. The sale is notable as one of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single building in New York City history; in November 2018, Google announced plans to expand its New York offices to accommodate 12,000 employees. In the same December, it was announced that a $1 billion, 1.7 million square foot (160,000 square meters) Google headquarters will be built in Manhattan's Hudson Square neighborhood. The new campus, called Google Hudson Square, is expected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York City.
In late 2006, Google established a new headquarters for its AdWords division in Ann Arbor, Michigan; in November 2006, Google opened an office on the Carnegie Mellon University campus in Pittsburgh to focus on shopping-related ad coding and smart phone applications and programs. Other U.S. office locations include Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Boulder, Colorado; Cambridge, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Kirkland, Washington; Birmingham, Michigan; Virginia Reston, Washington, D.C., and Madison, Wisconsin, among others.
There are also product R&D sites in cities around the world, as well as in Sydney (birthplace of Google Maps) and London (part of Android development) In November 2013, Google announced plans to build a new 1 million square foot London headquarters that will house 4,500 employees As of the January contract announcement Known as one of the largest commercial real estate acquisitions ever, Google submitted plans for its new headquarters to Camden City Council in June 2017.In May 2015, Google announced its intention to build its own campus in Hyderabad, India. The new campus will reportedly be the company's largest outside the U.S. and will house 13,000 employees.
Google has a total of 85 global offices worldwide, including 32 in North America (including three in Canada) and 29 in the United States. There are 6 offices in the Latin America region, 24 in Europe (including 3 in the UK), 18 in Asia Pacific, mainly 4 in India and 3 in China, and 5 in Africa Middle East.
Infrastructure
Google has data centers in North America, South America, Asia, and Europe. While there is no official data on the number of servers in Google's data centers, research and advisory firm Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google had 2.5 million servers at that time. Traditionally, Google relied on parallel computing using commodity hardware such as mainstream x86 computers (similar to home PCs) to keep the cost per query low In 2005, Google began developing its own designs, which became evident in 2009.
Google built its own undersea communications cable. The first cable, named Curie, connected California and Chile and was completed on November 15, 2019. The second undersea cable, wholly owned by Google, is named Dunant and connects the United States and France, and is scheduled to be operational in 2020. Google's third submarine cable, Equiano, will connect Lisbon, Portugal, to Lagos, Nigeria, and Cape Town, South Africa. The company's fourth cable, named Grace Hopper, connects landing sites in New York, USA; Bude, UK; and Bilbao, Spain, and will be operational in 2022.
ENVIRONMENT
In October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of solar panels to provide up to 1.6 megawatts of electricity to meet about 30% of the campus' energy needs. The system is the largest rooftop solar farm ever built on a corporate campus in the U.S. and one of the largest on a corporate campus in the world. since 2007, google has been committed to being carbon neutral with respect to its business activities.
In September 2011, Google announced that it "continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes," which is almost 260 million watts, or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. 2010 total carbon emissions were just under 1.5 million tons, mostly from fossil fuels that power the data center. Most of these emissions came from fossil fuels. According to Google, 25% of its energy came from renewable fuels in 2010. Since the average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, global searches account for only 12.5 million watts, or 5% of Google's total electricity consumption.
In 2010, Google Energy made its first investment in renewable energy projects, investing $38.8 million in two wind farms in North Dakota. The company announced that the two sites would generate 169.5 megawatts of electricity and supply 55,000 homes. in February 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gave Google authorization to buy and sell energy at market prices. In September 2013, Google announced that it would exercise this authorization and purchase all electricity produced by the yet-to-be-built 240-megawatt Happy Hareford wind farm.
In July 2010, Google signed a 20-year agreement with an Iowa wind farm to purchase 114 megawatts of electricity.
In December 2016, Google announced that beginning in 2017, it will purchase renewable energy equivalent to 100% of its data center and office energy use. This commitment makes Google "the world's largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy."
In November 2017, Google purchased 536 megawatts of wind power. With this purchase, the company achieved 100% renewable energy. Wind energy will come from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa, and one in Oklahoma.In September 2019, Google's chief executive officer announced plans to invest $2 billion in wind and solar power, the largest renewable energy deal in corporate history. This will increase the company's green energy by 40% and add 1.6 gigawatts of clean energy.
In September 2020, Google announced that it had retroactively offset all of its carbon emissions since its founding in 1998. It also pledged to run its data centers and offices solely on carbon-free energy by 2030.In October 2020, the company committed to making its hardware product packaging 100% plastic-free and 100% recyclable by 2025. The company also pledged to achieve UL2799 "zero waste to landfill" certification for all final assembly and manufacturing sites by 2022, and to recycle the majority of waste generated in the manufacturing process instead of landfilling it in landfills.
Climate Change Denial and Misinformation
Google has donated to climate change denialist political groups such as the State Policy Network and the Competitive Enterprise Institute. The company also actively funds and profits from climate change disinformation by monetizing ad space on most climate change disinformation sites. Google continued to generate revenue from sites that spread climate disinformation even after the company updated its policies to prohibit advertising on similar sites.
Philanthropy
In 2004, Google established Google.org, a non-profit philanthropic organization, with $1 billion in founding funds. The organization's mission is to raise awareness about climate change, global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle capable of getting 100 miles per gallon. Google hired Larry Brilliant as executive director of the program in 2004, and Megan Smith later replaced him as director.
In March 2007, Google partnered with the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) to host the first Julia Robinson Math Festival at its headquarters in Mountain View; in 2011, Google donated €1 million to the International Mathematical Olympiad for the next five years (2011-2015) to The company supported the Olympiad.In July 2012, Google launched the "Legalize Love" campaign in support of gay rights.
In 2008, Google announced "Project 10100," a call for ideas to help the community and allow Google users to vote on their favorites After two years of silence, many wondered what happened to the program, but Google revealed the winner of the project and awarded a total of $10 million to ideas ranging from nonprofits that promote education to websites that intend to put all legal documents online.
In response to the humanitarian crisis following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Google announced a $15 million donation to help Ukrainian citizens. The company also decided to convert its Warsaw office into a help center for refugees.
Also in February 2022, Google announced that it will join with nonprofits Year Up, Social Finance, and Merit America to establish a $100 million fund to expand skills training and job placement for low-income Americans.
Criticisms and Controversy
Google has been criticized for aggressive tax avoidance, search neutrality, copyright, censorship of search results and content, and privacy.
Other criticisms include allegations of misuse or manipulation of search results, use of other people's intellectual property, concerns that compiling data may violate people's privacy, and server energy consumption, as well as concerns about traditional business issues such as monopolies, restraint of trade, anticompetitive practices, and patent infringement.
Google previously complied with the People's Republic of China's Internet censorship policy enforced by a filter commonly referred to as the "Great Firewall of China," but does not currently comply. As a result, all Google services, with the exception of Google Maps in China, are blocked from access within mainland China unless they use virtual private networks, proxy servers, or other similar technologies.
2018
In July 2018, Chris Peterson, a program manager at Mozilla, accused Google of intentionally slowing the performance of YouTube on Firefox.
In August 2018, The Intercept reported that Google is developing a censored version of its search engine (known as Dragonfly) for the People's Republic of China that "blacklists websites and search terms related to human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest. However, the project was kept private due to privacy concerns.
2019
In 2019, a hub of Google critics gathered in the Reddit online community /r/degoogle with the goal of refraining from using Google products. The DeGoogle grassroots campaign continues to grow as privacy activists highlight information about Google products and related violations of personal privacy rights by the company.
In April 2019, former Mozilla executive Jonathan Nightingale accused Google of deliberately and systematically sabotaging the Firefox browser over the past decade to promote the spread of Google Chrome. In November 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights launched an investigation into the Nightingale Project to assess whether the "mass collection of personal medical records" complies with HIPAA. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google launched the project in 2018 in secret with Ascension, a St. Louis-based healthcare company.
2022
In 2022, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that court documents suggest that Google sponsored Project Vivian, a secret project to counsel employees and discourage them from forming a union.
2023
On May 1, 2023, Google placed an ad on its Brazilian search home page opposing the anti-information Brazilian Congressional Bill No. 2630, which was about to be approved, urging users to ask their Congressional representatives to oppose the bill. The country's government and judicial authorities accused the company of unjustly interfering in congressional deliberations and ordered the company to change the ad within two hours of notification or face a fine of R$1 million (2023) (US$185,528.76) per hour of violation, which constituted an abuse of economic power. The company then promptly removed the ad.
Racially Targeted Surveillance
Google has supported controversial governments in mass surveillance projects, including sharing the identities of people protesting racial injustice with police and the military. in 2020, the company collected information from all android users who participated in the "Black Lives Matter" protests in Seattle, including location information shared with the FBI, including those who refused to be collected.
Google is also part of Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion contract between technology companies Google and Amazon to provide artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other cloud computing services to Israel and its military. The contract has been criticized by shareholders as well as employees over concerns that the project will lead to further violations of Palestinian human rights against the backdrop of the ongoing illegal occupation and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ariel Koren, Google's former marketing manager for education products and an outspoken critic of the project, said that Google has "systematically silenced Palestinian, Jewish, Arab, and Muslim voices who are concerned about Google's complicity in Palestinian human rights violations, formally retaliating against workers and creating an environment of fear," he wrote.
