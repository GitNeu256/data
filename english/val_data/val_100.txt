The Sovereign LORD is my strength! He makes me as surefooted as a deer*, able to tread upon the heights. *Or He gives me the speed of a deer. The Lord God is my Strength, my personal bravery, and my invincible army; He makes my feet like hinds’ feet and will make me to walk [not to stand still in terror, but to walk] and make [spiritual] progress upon my high places [of trouble, suffering, or responsibility]! I love Habakkuk 3:19! It paints a picture of what strength looks like. In this verse, God tells you that He will make your “feet” like the mountain deer. As you walk with the Lord and lean on Him, your footsteps are secure even on the roughest paths. Mountain deer can move quickly and leap as high as eight feet in the air. The Lord will cause you to make the same kind of progress in life—moving with speed, and jumping high and forcefully. Notice that God gives you the feet of a deer for the high places of challenge and responsibility. Climbing a mountain or hill is a lot more difficult than walking on flat land. The paths are sometimes narrow and covered with rocks. It’s here where you experience the freshest and purest air, the most exquisite scenery. Strength means abundance and plenty. This theme appears throughout the Bible. God always brings lots of whatever you need to the table. You may not like facing challenges. You might not like responsibility. However, those experiences give you a viewpoint you might never see without them. A chameleon is adaptable. They can change colors and blend into whatever the background. God will be what you need Him to be in whatever situation you are in. He has many names including Jehovah Jireh, the God who provides, Jehovah Shalom, the God of peace and more. God wants us to be flexible enough to go with His flow. He does not want us stuck in our own way of doing things. He desires us to have a willingness to change. Habakkuk 3:19 from the Amplified Bible says, “The Lord God is my Strength, my personal bravery, and my invincible army. God fights for you! Make Habakkuk 3:19 your personal faith declaration. Say it out loud many times per day and soak up the truth of this verse. The Lord wants to be to you all this verse expresses.
