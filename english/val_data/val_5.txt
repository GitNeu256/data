The maze is made of gray stone or concrete with a scrolling background of a blood splatter. You can fly above some of the broken paths using the Fairy or Spacesuit effect. Optionally, the Twintails Monster mask and the Sprite mask obtainable from the Mask Shop can also used with the same purpose.
There are two Scary Faces in this area that will send you to an isolated area if you are caught. You can evade them using the Bug effect.
To get to the Bowling Zone, travel south and continue until you see a red bowling ball (this is the portal). There's a seemingly inaccessible platform a bit south of the bowling ball containing what appears to be a wooden door with a colorful window, which is an entrance to Blood World. Using Fairy or Spacesuit on the ledge just east of it will allow you to float your way onto that platform.
Kanashii-Tan can be found by going in the following directions at the first-encountered intersections (starting from the intersection right before the portal to the Bowling Zone): east, south, east. There should be a small, tunneled entrance; Kanashii-Tan is inside this room. There's another tunnel close to the entrance to the Spelling Room which will deposit you directly outside Kanashii-tan's tunnel once followed.
If you take a left at the intersection right before the Bowling Zone portal, then go north at the second intersection after that and continue north, you'll encounter a portal to the Spelling Room.
The Scary Faces in the maze will teleport you to a sectioned off area with four humanoids with an eye for head. Using the Eyeball Bomb effect will make them run in your direction and stare at you. If they surround you, they will force you to unequip Eyeball Bomb, effectively forcing you to pinch yourself awake to escape.
Using the door in Seishounen's apartment will teleport you to an isolated platform in this map, containing a portal to the Magnet Room.
