The Z28 was a computer built by Konrad Zuse in Germany between 1963 and 1967. It was an improved version of the Z27, and it was the first computer in Europe to use magnetic core memory for storage.
The Z28 was a transistor-based computer, and it was much faster and more efficient than the Z3. It was also much smaller and lighter, making it more practical for commercial use.
The Z28 was programmed using a punched tape system, like the Z24, Z26, and Z27. However, the Z28's tape system was more advanced, and it allowed for more complex programs.
The Z28 was capable of performing a variety of mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It could also be used to solve equations and to perform other calculations.
The Z28 was used by a variety of companies in Germany, including Siemens, AEG, and Lufthansa. It was also used by universities and research institutions.
The Z28 was a significant achievement in the development of computing. It showed that it was possible to build a commercial computer that was fast, efficient, and affordable. It also helped to establish Germany as a leader in the field of computing.
Here are some of the key features of the Z28:
* Programming: The Z28 was programmed using a punched tape system. The tape consisted of a series of holes that represented the instructions for the computer.
* Computation: The Z28 was capable of performing a variety of mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It could also be used to solve equations and to perform other calculations.
* Architecture: The Z28 was a transistor-based computer, and it was much faster and more efficient than the Z3. It was also much smaller and lighter.
* Storage: The Z28 was the first computer in Europe to use magnetic core memory for storage.

Here are some of the specific differences between the Z27 and Z28:
* Architecture: The Z28 was a transistor-based computer, while the Z27 was a relay-based computer. This made the Z28 much faster and more efficient.
* Storage: The Z28 used magnetic core memory for storage, while the Z27 used core memory. This made the Z28 even faster and more efficient for storing large amounts of data.
* Programming: The Z28 used a more advanced programming language than the Z27. This made it easier to write programs for the Z28.
The Z28 was a significant improvement over the Z27, and it helped to establish Germany as a leader in the field of computing.
The Z28 was a landmark computer in the history of computing. It was the first computer in Europe to use magnetic core memory for storage, which made it much faster and more efficient than previous computers. The Z28 was also the first computer in Europe to use a compiler, which made it easier to write programs for the computer.
The Z28 was used by a variety of companies and organizations in Germany, including Siemens, AEG, and Lufthansa. It was also used by universities and research institutions. The Z28 helped to establish Germany as a leader in the field of computing, and it paved the way for the development of more advanced computers in the years to come.
Here are some additional details about the Z28:
* The Z28 had a clock speed of 2.5 MHz.
* It had a memory capacity of 16,384 bytes.
* It could perform 100,000 floating-point operations per second.
* It cost about \$250,000.
