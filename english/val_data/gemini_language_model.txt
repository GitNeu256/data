Every technological shift is an opportunity to advance scientific discovery, accelerate human progress, and improve lives. I believe that the transition to AI we are seeing now will be the most significant in our lifetimes; AI has the potential to create opportunities for all people, from the everyday to the extraordinary. It will usher in a new wave of innovation and economic progress, driving knowledge, learning, creativity, and productivity on an unprecedented scale.
This is an opportunity to make AI useful to everyone, everywhere in the world.
Nearly eight years after we began our journey as an AI-first company, the pace of progress is only accelerating: millions of people are using our entire suite of products to do things they couldn't do even a year ago, like finding answers to more complex questions or using new tools to collaborate and create We are using generative AI. At the same time, developers are using our models and infrastructure to build new generative AI applications, and startups and companies around the world are growing with our AI tools.
This is incredible momentum, and we have only begun to scratch the surface of what is possible.
We are taking a bold and responsible approach to this work. That means being ambitious in our research and pursuing capabilities that will bring enormous benefits to people and society, while building safeguards and working with governments and experts to address the risks that arise as AI capabilities grow. And we will continue to invest in the best tools, foundational models, and infrastructure based on AI principles, and implement them in our products and others.
Gemini is our highest-performance and most popular model to date, with leading-edge performance on many major benchmarks. The first version, Gemini 1.0, is optimized for different sizes: Ultra, Pro, and Nano. These are the first models of the Gemini era and the first realization of the vision we had when we founded Google DeepMind earlier this year. This new era of models represents one of the greatest scientific and engineering efforts we have undertaken as a company. We are truly excited about what lies ahead and the opportunities Gemini will unleash for people everywhere."

Introduction to Gemini
AI is at the heart of my life's work, as are many of my research colleagues, and throughout my years of programming AI for computer games as a teenager and as a neuroscience researcher trying to understand how the brain works, I have always believed that if we can build smarter machines, we can leverage them to I have always believed that if we could build smarter machines, we could harness them to bring incredible benefits to humanity.
This promise of a world empowered responsibly by AI continues to drive our work at Google DeepMind. For a long time, we have wanted to build a new generation of AI models inspired by the way people understand and interact with the world. Not smart software, but something more useful and intuitive - AI that feels like an expert helper or assistant.
Today we are one step closer to this vision. Meet Gemini, the most capable and general model we have ever created.
Gemini is the result of a massive collaborative effort by teams across Google, including our colleagues at Google Research. In short, it generalizes, seamlessly understands, manipulates, and combines different types of information, including text, code, audio, images, and video.
Introducing Gemini: The Biggest, Most Capable AI Model
Gemini is also the most flexible model to date, capable of running efficiently anywhere from data centers to mobile devices. Its cutting-edge capabilities greatly enhance the way developers and enterprise customers build and scale with AI.
We have optimized Gemini 1 to be the best of its kind. 0, our first version, comes in three different sizes
* Gemini Ultra - the largest and most powerful model for very complex tasks.
* Gemini Pro - the best model for scaling a wide range of tasks.
* Gemini Nano - the most efficient model for on-device tasks.
Cutting-Edge Performance
We have rigorously tested Gemini models and evaluated their performance on a variety of tasks. From natural image, speech, and video comprehension to mathematical reasoning, Gemini Ultra's performance exceeds current state-of-the-art results in 30 of the 32 academic benchmarks widely used in large-scale language model (LLM) research and development.
The benchmarks use a combination of 57 subjects, including mathematics, physics, history, law, medicine, and ethics, and test both global knowledge and problem-solving skills.
Our new benchmark approach to MMLU allows Gemini to use reasoning skills to think more carefully before answering difficult questions, a significant improvement over just using first impressions.
Gemini Ultra also achieved a state-of-the-art score of 59.4% on the new MMMU benchmark, which consists of multimodal tasks across different domains that require deliberate reasoning.
In the image benchmarks we tested, Gemini Ultra outperformed previous state-of-the-art models without the help of optical character recognition (OCR) systems that extract text from images for further processing. These benchmarks highlight Gemini's native multimodality and show early signs of Gemini's more complex inference capabilities.
Next-Generation Capabilities
Until now, the standard approach to creating multimodal models has been to train separate components for different modalities and stitch them together to roughly mimic some of the functionality. Such models may be good at performing specific tasks, such as describing an image, but may struggle with more conceptual and complex reasoning.
We designed Gemini as a native multimodal model and pre-trained it with different modalities from the beginning. We then added multimodal data and fine-tuned it to further refine its effectiveness. This allows Gemini to seamlessly understand and infer all types of inputs from scratch, far better than existing multimodal models.
Sophisticated Reasoning
Gemini 1.0's sophisticated multimodal inference capabilities help users understand complex textual and visual information. As such, it excels at discovering knowledge that is difficult to discern from vast amounts of data.
Their exceptional ability to extract insights from hundreds of thousands of documents by reading, filtering, and understanding information will help bring new breakthroughs at digital speed in many fields, from science to finance.
Understanding text, images, audio, and more
Gemini 1.0 is trained to recognize and understand text, images, and audio simultaneously, allowing it to better understand nuanced information and answer questions about complex topics. This makes it particularly well suited to explain reasoning in complex subjects such as mathematics and physics.
Advanced Coding
The first version of Gemini can understand and explain the world's most popular programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, and Go, and generate high-quality code. Its ability to work across languages and reason about complex information makes it one of the world's leading foundational models for coding.
Gemini Ultra has been recognized by several, including HumanEval, an important industry standard for evaluating performance on coding tasks, and Natural2Code, our internal holdover dataset that uses author-generated sources instead of web-based information. It excels in coding benchmarks.
Gemini can also be used as an engine for more advanced coding systems; two years ago we introduced AlphaCode, the first AI code generation system to reach a competitive level in programming contests.
Using a special version of Gemini, we developed a more advanced code generation system, AlphaCode 2. AlphaCode 2 excels not only in coding, but also in solving competition programming problems involving complex mathematics and theoretical computer science.
Gemini excels at coding and competition programming.
When evaluated on the same platform as the original AlphaCode, AlphaCode 2 shows massive improvements and solves nearly twice as many problems. It is also estimated to outperform 85% of the competition participants (approximately 50% of AlphaCode). AlphaCode 2 performance can be further improved if programmers cooperate by defining specific properties of code samples for AlphaCode 2 to follow.
We expect that programmers will increasingly be able to leverage highly capable AI models as collaborative tools to reason about problems, suggest code designs, and assist in implementation.
More reliable, scalable and efficient
We trained Gemini 1.0 on an AI-optimized infrastructure at scale using Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) v4 and v5e designed in-house at Google. We then trained it as the most reliable and scalable model and designed it to deliver services in the most efficient way.
On TPU, Gemini runs significantly faster than previous, smaller, less capable models. These custom-designed AI accelerators have been at the heart of Google's AI-powered products that serve billions of users, including Search, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Play, and Android. They have also enabled companies around the world to cost-effectively train large-scale AI models.
Today, we are announcing Cloud TPU v5p, the most powerful, efficient, and scalable TPU system ever designed for training cutting-edge AI models. This next-generation TPU will accelerate Gemini's development and enable developers and enterprise customers to train large scale generative AI models faster, enabling new products and features to be available to customers faster.
Building on Responsibility and Security at the Core
Google is committed to promoting bold and responsible AI in everything we do, building on Google's AI principles and strong safety policies across Google products, and adding new protections that take into account Gemini's multimodal capabilities. At each stage of development, we consider potential risks and work to test and mitigate them.
Gemini has the most comprehensive safety assessment of any Google AI model to date, including bias and toxicity. We conducted novel research on potential risk areas such as cyber attacks, persuasion, and autonomy, and applied Google Research's best-in-class adversarial testing techniques to help identify critical safety issues prior to Gemini's deployment.
To identify blind spots in our internal assessment methodology, we worked with a diverse set of external experts and partners to stress test our model across a range of issues.
To diagnose content safety issues during Gemini's training phase and ensure that the output follows our policies, we used a set of 100,000 prompts of varying degrees of toxicity pulled from the web, developed by experts at the Allen AI Institute We are using benchmarks such as Real Toxicity Prompts, a set of 100,000 prompts with varying degrees of toxicity pulled from the web, developed by experts at the Allen AI Institute. More details on this study will be published soon.
To limit harm, we built a dedicated safety classifier that identifies, labels, and screens content that contains, for example, violence or negative stereotypes. Combined with a robust filter, this layered approach is designed to make Gemini safer and more inclusive for everyone. In addition, we continue to address known challenges with the model, such as facticity, rationale, attribution, and corroboration.
Responsibility and security will always be central to the development and deployment of our model, and through organizations such as MLCommons, the Frontier Model Forum and its AI Safety Fund, the Secure AI Framework (SAIF) designed to mitigate security risks inherent in public and private AI systems, and Through organizations such as SAIF, we partner with industry and the broader ecosystem to define best practices and set safety and security benchmarks. We will continue to partner with researchers, governments, and civil society groups around the world as we develop Gemini.
