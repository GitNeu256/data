The Mars rover Opportunity was freed by scientists from nearly five weeks of being buried in sand dunes and began rolling freely across the Martian surface Saturday, NASA officials announced.
Engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the mission, cheered when images beamed back to Earth showed the rover's wheels were free.
They said, "The rover we spent $400 million on Mars is working." We'd rather spend that than lose it."
Photos taken by Opportunity and posted on the institute's website showed the wheel's long footprints across featureless sand dunes.
Opportunity's wheels began slipping on April 26 during a scheduled 295-foot run. As it attempted to climb over a foot-high dune, the robotic rover stopped moving and the wheels stuck to the hub in the soft soil.
Engineers spent weeks building a mockup of Opportunity and figuring out what commands to give to release the robot, but the operation took time. The rover didn't move forward a foot in a month and lost most of its traction every time it tried to roll.
It's like swimming," Erickson said.
But on Saturday morning, data showed that Opportunity finally broke free and moved a few feet over the dunes.
Ericsson said engineers want to make sure the probe does not encounter patches that could trap it again. A test run would be ordered Monday or Tuesday night, he said.
Opportunity and its twin rover Spirit have been exploring opposite sides of Mars since landing in January 2004. Both rovers have long since completed their primary three-month missions.
