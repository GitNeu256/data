The opportunity, also called Mer–B (Mars Exploration Rover-B) or MER-1, is a robot rover that was active on Mars from 2004 to 2018. Opportunity was operated on Mars at 5111 Sol (14 years on Earth, 138 days). Launched as part of nasa's Mars Exploration Rover program in 2003/7/7, it landed at Meridiani Planum in 2004/1/25, 3 weeks after its twin Spirit (Mer・A) landed on the other side of the planet. With a planned 90 Sol activity period (slightly less than 92.5 Earth days), Spirit will be stuck in 2009 and will function until it stops communicating in 2010, while Opportunity will be able to maintain 5111 Sol operations after landing, use solar power to continuously recharge batteries, and hibernate to save power during events such as dust storms. It was. This careful operation allowed it to operate 14 years and 47 days (Earth time) beyond the original plan and 57 times the designed life span. By 2018/6/10, when we last contacted NASA, the rover was traveling a distance of 45.16 kilometers (28.06 miles).
Highlights of the mission included the first 90sol mission, the discovery of meteorites such as the Heat Shield lock (Meridiani Planum meteorite), and more than two years of exploration and research of the Victoria Crater. The rover survived a moderate sandstorm and in 2011 reached Endeavour Crater, considered the "2nd landing site.""The Opportunity mission is considered one of NASA's most successful ventures 1.
Due to the 2018 dust storm on Mars, Opportunity stopped communicating on 6/10 and went into hibernation on 2018/6/12. It was expected to restart when the weather was clear, but it didn't suggest a catastrophic failure or that a layer of dust was covering the solar panels. NASA hopes to resume contact with the rover, citing a period of regular windy weather predicted from 2018-11 to 2019-1, which could potentially clean its solar panels. In 2019/2/13, NASA officials declared that the opportunity mission was completed after the spacecraft did not respond to more than 2018/8 signals sent after 1,000.
Purpose
The scientific objectives of the Mars Rover mission were:
* Search and characterize a variety of rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity. In particular, the samples required include those containing minerals deposited by water-related processes such as precipitation, evaporation, sedimentary cement, or hydrothermal activity.
* Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks and soil surrounding the landing site.
* Determine what geological processes have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry. Such processes can include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanic activity, and crater formation.
* Perform calibration and verification of surface observations made by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) instruments. This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments investigating the geology of Mars from orbit.
* Search for iron-containing minerals to identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or formed in water, such as iron-containing carbonates.
* Characterize the mineralogy and texture of rocks and soils to determine the process that created them.
* Search for geological clues to environmental conditions that existed when liquid water was present.
* Assess whether those environments were conducive to life.
Mission Timeline
Opportunity Rover and Spirit Rover were part of the Mars Exploration Rover program of the long-term Mars Exploration Program. The 4 main goals of the Mars exploration program were to determine whether there is a possibility of life on Mars (in particular, whether there is recoverable water on Mars), to characterize the climate of Mars and its geology, and to prepare for potential human missions to Mars. The Mars rover was supposed to travel around the Martian surface, conduct regular geological analysis, determine whether water exists on Mars, the types of minerals available, and back up data captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). Both rovers were designed with the expected lifespan of 90 sols (92 Earth days), but each lasted much longer than expected. The Spirit's mission lasted 20 times longer than the expected life span, and its mission was declared to have ended in 2011/5/25, trapped in the soft sand and spending a power reserve trying to free itself. The opportunity lasted 90 times longer than the planned life of 55 sols and operated for 5498 days from landing to the end of the mission. An archive of weekly updates on Rover status can be found in the Opportunity Update Archive.
Launch and landing
Spirit and Opportunity were launched in 2003/6/10 and 7/8/1 months apart, both reaching the Martian surface by 2004/1. The launch of Opportunity was managed by NASA's Launch Services program. This was the first launch of the Delta II Heavy. The launch period was from 2003-6-25 to 7-15. The first launch attempt took place in 2003-6-28, but due to the safety of cruising range and wind delay, it was launched 9 days later in 2003-7-7, after which the items on the rocket (insulation and battery) were replaced. Every day, there were 2 momentary launch opportunities. ON the day of LAUNCH, the launch was postponed to the 2nd occasion (11:18PM EDT) to SECURE the valve.
2004/1/25 (GMT) (2004/1/24, PST), an airbag-protected lander landed on the Martian surface of Eagle Crater.
From the first landing, Opportunity managed to land on a collision crater, generally surrounded by flat plains, to survey samples of regolith and rock, and to take panoramic photos of the landing site. Its sampling allowed NASA scientists to make hypotheses about the presence of hematite on the surface of Mars and the presence of water in the past. This was followed by being instructed to traverse the surface of Mars in 2004 to survey Endurance crater, another crater site we explored between 6 and 12 months. Opportunity then examined the impact site of its own heat shield and found an intact meteorite on the surface of Mars, now known as a heat shield rock.
The opportunity was directed between 2005-10 and 2006-3 to proceed southward to the Erebus Crater, a large, shallow, partially buried crater, with a stopover on the way south towards the Victoria Crater. The robot arm encountered some mechanical problems.
In late 2006/9, Opportunity reached the Victoria Crater and explored clockwise along the rim. In 2007/6 he returned to Duck Bay, the original arrival point of the Victoria Crater, and in 2007/9 he entered the crater to begin a detailed study. In 2008-8, the Opportunity left Victoria Crater and headed for Endeavour Crater, reaching 2011-8-9.
At the edge of Endeavour Crater, the rover moved around a geographical feature named Cape York. The Mars reconnaissance orbiter detected philosilicate there, and the rover analyzed the rock with its equipment to check for this sighting on the ground. This structure was analyzed in detail until the summer of 2013. In 2013/5, the rover was heading south to a hill named Solander Point.
The total mileage of opportunity to 2018/6/10 (sol5111) was 45.16km (28.06 mi) and the dust factor was 10.8. Since 2013/1, the dust coefficient of the solar array (one of the determinants of solar power production) has changed from 2013/12/5, a relatively dusty 0.467 (sol3507) to 2014/5/13, a relatively clean 0.964 (sol3662).
In 2014/12, NASA reported that Opportunity suffered from an event of "memory loss" in which the rover failed to write data, e.g. telemetry information, to nonvolatile memory. The hardware failure was thought to be due to an age-related failure in one of the Rover's 7 memory banks, which was 1. As a result, NASA was aiming to cause the Rover's software to ignore the failed memory bank, but memory loss events continued to occur, eventually causing the vehicle to reset. In light of this, in Sol4027 (2015/5/23), the rover was configured to operate in RAM-only mode and did not fully use nonvolatile memory for storage.
End of Mission
In early 2018/6, a massive planetary-scale sandstorm occurred, and within a few days the rover's solar panels did not generate enough power to maintain communication, and in 2018/6/10 there was the last contact. NASA said it did not expect communications to resume until after the storm subsided, but the rover remained silent after the storm ended in early May, suggesting either a catastrophic failure or a layer of dust covering the solar panels.10 The team continued to expect that the windy period between 2018/11 and 2019/1 may remove dust from the solar panels, as has happened before. The wind was detected nearby on 1/8, and on 1/26 the mission team announced plans to start broadcasting a new series of commands to the rover in case the radio receiver fails.
In 2019/2/12, past and present members of the mission team gathered at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) space Flight Operations facility to watch the final command sent to Opportunity via a 70-meter (230-foot) dish at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in California. After sending the last 4 sets of commands for 25 minutes, attempts to communicate with the Rover were handed over to Canberra, Australia.
Since the signal was lost in 2018/6, by the end of 2019/1, more than 835 recovery commands were sent, and by 2019/2/13, more than 1000 recovery commands were sent. NASA officials held a press conference to declare the official end of the mission on 2/13. NASA Associate Administrator thomas Zurbuchen said, "Therefore, I stand here with deep gratitude and gratitude for declaring that the Opportunity mission has been completed."When NASA finished its attempt to contact the rover, the last data sent was the song "I'll Be Seeing You," played by Billy Holliday. The assets that were needed to support the Martian probe were migrated to support the curiosity and perseverance of the Martian probe.
The final communication from the rover was made from the Parthervia Valley in 2018/6/10 (Sol 5111), showing that the energy production of Sol's solar array is 22 watt hours, and the highest atmospheric opacity (tau) measured so far on Mars is 10.8.
Design and construction
Opportunity (and its twin Spirit) is a six-wheeled, solar-powered robot 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) high, 2.3 meters (7.5 feet) wide, 1.6 meters (5.2 feet) long and weighing 180 kilograms (400 pounds). Six wheels on the rocker-bogey system allowed mobility on rough terrain. Each wheel had its own motor. The vehicle was piloted back and forth and was designed to operate safely at a tilt of up to 30 degrees. The top speed was 5 centimeters per second (2.0 inches per second) and 0.18 kilometers per hour (0.11 mph), while the average speed was about 1 centimeters per second (0.39 inches per second). Both Spirit and Opportunity have fallen World Trade Center metal shards that "became shields to protect cables in drilling mechanisms."
The solar array generated about 1 watt for up to 14 hours per sol 140 hours, and the rechargeable lithium-ion battery accumulated energy for use at night. Opportunity's onboard computer uses 128MHz RAD3CPU with 3MB of DRAM, 20MB of DRAM and 2000MB of EEPROM. The operating temperature range of the rover is-40-+40 At °C (-40 to 104°F), a radioisotope heater provides basic level heating, assisted by an electric heater if necessary.
Communication depended on omni-directional low-gain antennas that communicate at low data rates and maneuverable high-gain antennas that come in direct contact with the Earth. Low-gain antennas were also used to relay data to spacecraft orbiting Mars.
Power
The rover uses a combination of solar cells and rechargeable chemical batteries. The rover of this class has 2 rechargeable lithium batteries, each of which consists of 8 cells with a capacity of 8 ampere hours. At the start of the mission, the solar panel can provide up to about 1 watt-hour (Wh) to charge the battery and power system with one sol, but this can vary depending on a variety of factors. In Eagle Crater, the cell was producing about 840Wh, but by 2004-12 Sol319, it had dropped to 730Wh.
Like Earth, Mars has seasonal changes that reduce sunlight during winter. However, since the year on Mars is longer than the year on Earth, the seasons fully rotate almost 2 times in 1 Earth year. By 2016, the MER-B had endured 7 Martian winters, during which time power levels would drop, allowing the rover to avoid activities that use a lot of power. During its first winter power levels fell below 300Wh per day for two months, but after a few winters it wasn't so bad.
1. Another factor that can reduce the received power is dust in the atmosphere, especially sandstorms. Sandstorms occurred very often when Mars was closest to the Sun. The global sandstorm of 2007 reduced power levels for opportunity and spirit, allowing them to run for only a few minutes every day. Due to the 2018 sandstorm on Mars, the opportunity went into hibernation mode on 6/12, but remained silent after the storm subsided in early May 10.
Scientific knowledge
Opportunity has provided substantial evidence to support the mission's key scientific goal of searching and characterizing a wide range of rocks and legolith that hold clues to past water activity on Mars. In addition to water surveys, Opportunity also gets stargazing and atmospheric data.
Heritage and Honor
The rover was called "her" from the nautical tradition and was given the affectionate nickname "Oppy".One scientist, who has worked at Opportunity for more than 10 years, attributed this to the rover's unexpectedly long lifespan, which he called the "underdog beating the odds" and its "familiar, almost biologically inspired form" narrative."The media attention surrounding the shutdown of Opportunity has spread this usage to the public.
In 2019/2/12, with information that NASA could end Operation Opportunity, many media broadcasters and commentators issued a statement praising the success of the operation plan and saying goodbye to the rover. One journalist, Jacob Margolis, described the translation of the last data transmission sent by Opportunity in 2018 as "My battery is low and it's dark."6/10This phrase struck a chord with the public, inspiring a period of mourning, artwork and tributes to the memory of the occasion.
When the quote became widely reported, some news reports falsely claimed that the rover had sent its exact message in English, and as a result NASA was inundated with additional questions. Margolis wrote an article clarifying on 2/16, taking statements from NASA officials who were interpreting the data sent by Opportunity for both its low output and Mars' high atmospheric opacity state, and rephrasing them in a poetic way so as not to imply that the rover had sent a specific word. It was a great experience.
In honor of Opportunity's significant contribution to Mars exploration, the asteroid was named Opportunity:39382Opportunity. The name was proposed by Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld, who discovered the asteroid in 1960 with cornelis Johannes van Houten and Tom Gehrels924. Opportunity's lander is the Challenger Memorial Station.
In 2015/3/24, NASA celebrated the opportunity to travel a marathon race distance, 42.195 km (26.219 miles). The rover covered the distance in 11 years and 2 months. JPL technicians celebrated the occasion by running the race.
The documentary film "Good Night Oppy," about opportunity, spirit and their long mission, was directed by Ryan White and included support from JPL and Industrial Light & Magic. It was released in 2022.
Image
The Rover was able to take pictures with different cameras, but only the PanCam camera was able to shoot scenes with different color filters. Panoramic views are usually built from PanCam images. By 2018/2/3, Opportunity had returned 224,642 photos.
