Gameplay
Azur Lane is a side-scrolling shooter, simulation, and role-playing game. Players collect moe anthropomorphic characters ("shipgirls") from World War II warships. The main ships are the U.S. Navy, Royal Navy, Japanese Navy, and German Navy, with ships from the French Navy (Vichy Navy and Free French Navy), Republic of China Navy, People's Liberation Army Navy, Regia Marina, Soviet Navy, Imperial Russian Navy, and Imperial German Navy added later. Players organize these into a fleet of six ships and face off against AI-controlled enemies and other players' fleets. These ships gain experience points (EXP) in various ways (combat, completing missions, placement in dormitories, etc.), and a certain amount of EXP is required to gain stronger levels. There is a set limit to how much a ship can be upgraded, and this level can be increased by limit breaks. Most characters have upgradeable abilities, which can be activated during combat. The personifications of the American destroyer USS Laffey (DD-459), the British destroyer HMS Javelin, the German destroyer Z23 (Chinese and English versions), and the Japanese destroyer Ayanami (Japanese and Korean versions) can be selected as starter ships. Called the protagonist in the game, as of March 2021, more than 450 characters have appeared in the game, representing ships from nine countries that participated in the war. The game also features ships preserved in museums as characters, such as the Japanese Mikasa and the Russian Aurora.
A new game mode, Operation Siren, was announced on Twitter on December 13, 2020. When preparing for the game's main mode, players can form two fleets consisting of a front row and a back row (up to six fleets are unlocked as the game progresses), with three slots available for each row. The front row can contain destroyers, light cruisers, and heavy cruisers, while the back row can contain battleships, air cruisers, monitors, repair ships, combat ships, and aircraft carriers. Different combinations of ships are needed to achieve victory in different warfare situations. The player can then select a map to enter.
Once on the map, the player's fleet is placed on a grid-like map similar to the game Battleship. The map contains nodes, including battle nodes, which are enemy fleets, immobile nodes that pursue the player, non-combat nodes that provide ammunition, mystery nodes that provide supplies such as repair kits and upgrade materials, or nodes that can spawn special battle nodes called treasure fleets and so on. Players must optimally navigate and tactically organize their fleet, eliminate obstructing enemies, and reach the map's bosses with a minimum of movement. As players move their fleet around the map, they may be ambushed by random encounters, taking damage or engaging the enemy with fuel and ammunition. Fuel is one of the two resources in the game. Ammunition points are allocated to the player fleet for each map and are deducted one point for each battle. A fleet that runs out of ammunition can still fight, but may only do half damage.
During combat with the enemy, the player controls the front row with a virtual joystick, which can automatically fire shells at the target or manually fire torpedoes. While stationary, the rear column can fire artillery shells and the player can manually request an airstrike. When an airstrike is made, a bullet elimination effect is triggered and all bullets and torpedoes on the screen are eliminated. Players have the option of an auto mode, which allows them to delegate this control to the game's AI. Character strength is fully replenished upon completing or exiting the map. Morale points are deducted for each fleet character in combat. A character who falls in combat will no longer be able to participate in actions on that map, and more morale points will be deducted for the fallen character at the end of the combat. If a character's morale remains low, that character's status and affection points will be reduced. When affection points are low, the character will greet the player with vocals that reflect disappointment.
The game has a player versus player mode. The player prepares a defensive fleet and can organize an offensive fleet to challenge the other player's defensive fleet. In this mode, all battles are controlled by the AI, and the ammunition-rejecting effects of air strikes are nullified. Winning in this mode earns tokens and increases the player's ranking. There is no penalty to the player if he loses a challenge or if his defending fleet is defeated by another player. Tokens (which are called merits) can be used to obtain exclusive characters and other items. Rankings are updated every 15 days.
Additional mechanics were introduced after the game's release; in May 2018, a submarine and anti-submarine warfare system was introduced. This included anti-submarine campaign maps and characters based on German U-boats and American and Japanese submarines.In September 2018, the ship cat system was introduced. Various cat breeds are available in catteries. Cats can be trained to provide buffs when participating in combat with the fleet.
Dormitories
The game has a "dormitory" feature. The little characters are placed in a furnished dormitory where they can walk around, sit, sleep, and bathe. Characters can passively gain experience points and regain morale when given food by the player. Players can purchase food with fuel or in-game currency. Furniture sets and decorations of various themes, sometimes for a limited time, can also be purchased using "furniture coins," which are obtained by having characters participate in special quests. Furniture and decorations increase the rate of experience gain. They can be placed freely. Players can use in-game currency to increase dormitory capacity, unlock second floors that restore morale, and purchase special interactive furniture. Monuments can also be earned by completing event stages. You can also visit other players' dormitories.
Promise.
When a character's affinity (a type of level up in the game) reaches 100 through either battle, secretary, or dormitory, the player can give that character a "Promise Ring". The "Promise Ring" can only be obtained once in a quest. Additional rings can be purchased at the item store using in-game currency. The developer is also distributing these rings for free on special occasions. Players can also give these characters customized names, but only every 30 days per character. In addition, the most popular few characters will also earn unique wedding dress costumes for their weddings. Characters who are given a promise ring also receive an additional status bonus.
Synopsis.
The game opens with an anthropomorphic recreation of the Battle of the Denmark Strait, in which the famous British battleship HMS Hood is sunk by a character representing the German army. In this game, the countries of the Eagle Coalition (United States), Royal Navy (United Kingdom), Sakura Empire (Empire of Japan), Iron-Blooded (Nazi Germany), Dragon Emperor (Republic of China), Northern Parliament (Soviet Union), Iris Orthodox Church (France) and Sardinian Empire (Kingdom of Italy) The eponymous military alliance, Azur Lane, was formed and constituted by the The intervention of the aliens split the alliance in two, forming the "Crimson Axis" faction, which was opposed by the Iron Blood, the Sacra Empire, and the Sardinian Empire. Using technology provided by aliens called "Sirens," the Crimson Axis invades the former allies. As a result, much of the territory of Azur Lane came under Crimson Axis occupation, and the Iris Orthodox Church split into Iris Libre (Free France) and Vichy Dominion (Vichy France). The rest of the game's main plot partially follows the U.S. Navy's battles in the Pacific War. Each chapter represents several decisive battles of the war, including the Battle of Midway, the Battle of Guadalcanal, and the Mariana-Palau Islands campaign.
Development
Azur Lane's producer, Ewan, a well-known uploader for the Chinese video-sharing website Bilibili, began developing the game with five college friends with the initial idea of making a doujinshi game if a commercial one was impossible. After the success of "Ship Collection," the developers saw that many similar games had been created in the Greater China region, and they set out to create "something different from the previous ship moe anthropomorphic works. Therefore, they did not dare to adopt the turn-based strategy game mechanics that "Ship Collection" and many of its followers have adopted. We also shifted the focus from Japanese ships to those of other countries involved in World War II.
Particularly difficult was to incorporate elements of a shooter game, as there were no existing works to serve as references. An early version of the game featured a combat system in which a fleet of five characters fought in single or double rows. World of Warships, a World War II naval simulation game that became popular in China, influenced some of the gameplay design.
The developers differentiated the game by including characters based on museum-preserved ships, such as the World War I I IJN battleship Mikasa, which served as the flagship in the Russo-Japanese War, and the Russian protected cruiser Aurora, famous for its participation in the October Revolution. Although it was difficult to maintain game balance and rarity with these characters, the developers are enthusiastic about featuring museum ships and intend to do so in the future. with Wargaming, the publisher of World of Warships. As part of the collaboration, characters based on World War II warships, such as Neptune, Saint-Louis, and Ibuki, were introduced.
Many young voice actors participated in the game, some of them highly acclaimed. The decision to use all-Japanese voice actors, mainly young voice actors, was due to the lack of professional voice actors in China and the team's desire to give young Japanese voice actors a chance to play an active role. The cast includes Yui Ishikawa, Riyo Takahashi, and Risa Taneda.
Manjuu Ltd. of Shanghai is responsible for the audiovisual design and script for "Azur Lane. Yongshi Ltd. of Xiamen was in charge of programming, game data design, and content. Both companies are co-creators of the game and share copyright and 65%/35% of its revenue.
