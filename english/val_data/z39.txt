Z39 was a Type 1936A (Mob) destroyer built for the German Kriegsmarine during World War II.Groundbreaking took place in August 1940 and construction was completed three years later. Her anti-aircraft armament was greatly augmented during the war; Z39 was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 6 and was engaged in escorting transports, laying mines, and bombarding land-based units in the Baltic Sea; from 1943 to 1945 she served in the German Navy as Z39, from 1945 to 1947 as DD-939, and from 1948 to From 1948 to 1964, she served in the French Navy as Q-128.
During her service in Germany, the ship laid numerous mine barrages (concentrating explosives over a wide area) in the Baltic Sea and bombarded Soviet forces several times. Toward the end of the war, Z39 escorted steamers evacuating German soldiers and civilians from Eastern Europe to Denmark; Z39 was damaged twice, once by Soviet aircraft at Pardiski and once by British aircraft at Kiel. At the end of the war, the destroyer was transferred to the US Navy. The U.S. Navy tested the destroyer's equipment, especially the high-pressure steam propulsion plant. After the U.S. Navy determined that the ship was obsolete, she was transferred to the French Navy, cannibalized for parts, and converted into a pontoon boat for minesweepers.
Background
Intervellum.
After the end of World War I, Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles, which placed strict limits on the size and displacement of warships it could possess. During the Interbellum period, the period between World War I and World War II, the average size of Allied ships and their armament in almost all warship categories increased significantly. As a result of the treaty, Germany felt that its ships could not compete with those of the Allied navies and began to ignore the treaty, first in secret and later openly after Nazi Germany's Führer (dictator) Hitler openly condemned the treaty in March 1935. The drainage capacities of all German vessels at the time were deliberately understated in order to bring their official size into compliance with the Convention. Initially, these changes were made with the goal of matching or surpassing French and Polish destroyers, but later it became necessary for these destroyers to match the British destroyers.
Because the number of German shipyards was relatively small compared to the British and French, Germany adopted an excessive armament policy that allowed its destroyers to carry armament similar to that of French and Polish light cruisers in order to compensate for the small number of destroyers. This resulted in several adverse effects, including reduced speed and excessive weight of the destroyers. German heavy destroyers were equipped with armament comparable to that of British light cruisers, but were far less seaworthy and far less equipped to control and use their guns.
Plan Z
Plan Z was a German naval rearmament program that began in 1939 and called for the construction of 10 battleships, 4 aircraft carriers, 12 battle cruisers, 3 pocket battleships, 5 heavy cruisers, 44 light cruisers, 68 destroyers, and 249 submarines. These ships were to form two battle fleets. The "Home Fleet" to hold the British fleet in the North Sea, and the "Raiding Fleet" to wage war on the British convoys. German Navy Grand Admiral Erich Raeder had been assured by Hitler that the war would not start until at least 1945. Rader wanted to extend the deadline for completion of Plan Z to 1948, but Hitler insisted on 1945. Privately, Hitler wanted to be at war with the Anglo-French alliance by 1942. World War II began in 1939, and few German heavy cruisers had been completed by that time. Germany's main naval opponents were France and Great Britain. Compared to the number of ships Germany had at the time of entry (in parentheses), 22 battleships (2), 7 aircraft carriers (zero), 22 heavy cruisers (4), 61 light cruisers (6), 255 destroyers (34), and 135 submarines (57, of which less than half could actually serve in the Atlantic or North Sea). Because of the enemy's clear superiority, Rader remarked that the German Navy could not hope for victory and would have to "die bravely."
Functions of Destroyers
The function of the destroyer was defined by its evolution: around the 1870s, nations that could not directly threaten the Royal Navy began to invest in torpedo boats. Small and agile, they were able to inflict enough damage with their torpedoes to pose a tactical problem to the enemy fleet; by the turn of the 20th century, British and German torpedo boats had become so large that a separate family of ocean-going torpedo boats, the "torpedo boat destroyers" or simply destroyers, were built to counter their torpedo counterparts. The experience of World War I showed that destroyers rarely engaged mainline ships, but more often fought other destroyers and submarines. During the war, destroyers were used as "jack-of-all-trades," fulfilling virtually every role to some degree and participating in numerous operations, unlike the mainline ships, which rarely sailed during the war. By the end of the war, destroyers were recognized as one of the most useful naval classes.
During World War II, destroyers essentially performed the three basic functions of World War I: to serve as towing ships to protect their own fleet from the enemy fleet, to attack enemy towing ships, and to protect their own fleet from submarines. However, the introduction of anti-aircraft measures for destroyers became desirable, but many countries struggled to do so effectively. How destroyers were actually used varied from country to country. Germany did not use destroyers for defense against submarines. Hence, they did not have strong anti-submarine armaments. Germany relied instead on a large fleet of trawlers that were requisitioned and converted into minesweepers. British destroyers were built to escort the fleet, protect it from enemy aircraft, and sink submarines. German destroyers were built to escort the fleet or act as torpedo boats. The role of destroyers began to change more broadly as World War II progressed, with five parallel evolutions: all-purpose destroyers (all nations), anti-submarine destroyers (US and UK), anti-aircraft destroyers (Japan and UK), small destroyers (Germany and Italy), and super-size destroyers (France).
Design and Armament
The Z39 was a Type 1936A (mob) destroyer class. She was 121.9 meters (400 feet) long at the draught line, 127 meters (417 feet) long overall, with a beam of 12 meters (39 feet) and a draft of 4 meters (13 feet). The ship's discharge capacity when standard loaded was 2,519 tons (2,479 tons long and 2,777 tons short) and when fully loaded was 3,691 tons (3,633 tons long and 4,069 tons short). The crew consisted of 332 men.
Before her conversion under the Barbara Project to improve the anti-aircraft capability of German ships, she was equipped with seven 2cm anti-aircraft guns, two 3.7cm SK C/303.7cm It had seven (5-inch) anti-aircraft guns, one 15cm L/48 gun in the front turret, two 15cm L/48 guns in the rear turret, two 53.3cm quadruple torpedo tubes, and 60 mines The Z39's 15cm turret had Greek emblems on both sides. After modification, the Z39 was fitted with 18 2-cm and 14 3.7-cm continuous cannon, but the rest of its armament remained unchanged. The propulsion system consisted of six Wagner water tube boilers that generated high-pressure superheated steam at 70 bar (1,029 psi, 7,093 kPa) and 450 °C to feed two Wagner geared steam turbines. This produced a rated output of 70,000 shaft horsepower (52,000 kW) and a maximum speed of 38.5 knots (71.3 km/h, 44.3 mph). The range was 2,239 nautical miles (4,147 km; 2,577 miles) and cruising speed was 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph).
Z39's sensor suite housing included a FuMO 21 radar mounted on the bridge and four FuMB 4 Sumatra aerials mounted on the foremast searchlight. It was also equipped with several radars and radar detectors, including FuMB 3 Bali and FuMO 81 Berlin-S on the masthead and FuMO 63 Hohentweil K.
Inauguration History
The Z39 was ordered on June 26, 1939, and was broken ground on August 15, 1940, at the G629 yard in Kiel by Germain Averhout, launched on December 2, 1941, and commissioned on August 21, 1943. Due to the long construction period, commissioning was delayed, and Z39 did not become fully operational until January 7, 1944. There were several reasons for these construction problems. The small number of German shipyards forced the German Navy to prioritize construction, and there was a shortage of inexperienced naval engineers and workers. At some point between launching and commissioning, the ship was modified under the Barbara program to add three pairs of 3.7 cm anti-aircraft guns, one pair forward of the bridge, one pair aft of the funnel, and one pair forward of the funnel. The ship added a pair of 3.7cm single guns to the platform aft of the funnels. The destroyer was fitted with a pair of 2cm guns in the bridge wings; one 2cm gun and one 2cm single gun were added to the deckhouse in the third gun deck. After commissioning, she began minesweeping operations in the Skagerrak and Kattegat straits until March 1944, when she was transferred to Reval off the Gulf of Finland.
service in germany
After transfer to Reval, she was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 6 and served with German destroyers Z25, Z28, and Z35; on February 12-13, Z39 laid mines in the "Dorothea A" barrage with two other destroyers and three minesweepers; on March 10, she participated in a mine laying operation with two other destroyers On March 11-12, she bombarded Soviet forces near Narva-Josu; from March 13 to April 22, the destroyer participated in six minesweeping operations. One of these operations took place on April 13-14, when Z39, two other destroyers, and six minesweepers laid the "Seeigel 6b" mine barrage south of Suur Tytärsaari. The Z39, two other destroyers, and six minesweepers laid a "Seeigel 3b" mine barrage off Viglund Island in Narva Bay on April 16-17. On April 21-22, Z39, two other destroyers, and six minesweepers participated in the operation, which was aborted when one of the minesweepers struck a mine and sank. From April 25 to 26, Z39, two destroyers, and nine minesweepers laid the "Seeigel 8b" barrage southwest of Suur Tyärsaari. and 1,174 minesweepers were laid.
On June 23 of the same year, Z39 was damaged by Soviet bombers while anchored off Pardiski, and was escorted to Libau by Z28. Z39 was hit by Luftwaffe bombing of Kiel harbor, damaging the quarterdeck, and was towed to Svinemünde Z39 was repaired using cannibalized parts from Z44 and Z45 Z44 was damaged and sunk in an air raid on Bremen on July 29, but the superstructure remained above water and Z45 was built Z39 was repaired to a navigable degree on February 28, 1945, and was ordered to sail to Copenhagen for major repairs, but due to fuel shortages in Nazi Germany, she sailed to Zasnitz instead. At this time, the German Navy, which had always dealt with oil shortages, had reached critical levels of oil supply; repairs to Z39 were completed on March 25 while she was at Svinemünde, and she resumed operations on April 1. From April 5 to April 7, she escorted transports and part of Task Force Thiele around Danzig Bay. From April 8 to April 9, Z39 provided gunfire support to the Germans. On 10 April, together with T33 (torpedo boat), she escorted the German destroyer Z43, damaged by both mines and bombs, to Warnemünde and Svinemünde.
From 1944 onward, German surface vessels were called upon to support Northern forces in the Baltic. This often involved bombarding land targets for which the crews of German ships had not been trained. This tactical use of cruisers, destroyers, and torpedo boats was difficult in the restricted waterways of the Baltic Sea, but despite these difficulties, justified the survival of the surface fleet. The continued Soviet advance along the eastern Baltic coast also spurred this change: from the spring of 1945 until near the end of the war, Kriegsmarine's surface forces were focused almost entirely on supplying and supporting the garrisons along the Baltic coast; after March 1945, Kriegsmarine was able to get ahead of the rapidly advancing Soviet forces to the west. Z39 participated in many of these evacuation operations. on 15 April, Z39, along with two other destroyers and four torpedo boats, took the German steamers Matthias Stinnes, Eberhard Esberger, Pretoria, and Askari to Copenhagen with 20,000 evacuees. On May 2, the battleship Schlesien, along with the battleship Schlesien, moved to defend the bridge over the Peene River at Vorgast; on May 3, the battleship Schlesien moved to defend the bridge over the Peene River at Vorgast; on May 4, the battleship Schlesien, along with the battleship Schlesien, moved to defend the bridge over the Peene River at Vorgast. On the same day, after Schlesien struck a mine near Greifswalder Oie, Z39 towed Schlesien to Svinemünde, where Schlesien was intentionally grounded. Schlesien was intentionally grounded and positioned so that the ship's guns could fire and defend the roads leading into the city. A day later, Z39 and three other destroyers, one torpedo boat, one ship's boat, one auxiliary cruiser, one anti-aircraft gunboat, and five steamers sailed for Copenhagen, carrying 35,000 wounded soldiers and refugees. Germany surrendered on May 8, but some troops were still being evacuated; on May 8, the Z39, six destroyers, and five torpedo boats sailed from Hella for Glücksburg with 20,000 soldiers and civilians on board, arriving on May 9. After the German surrender, they were decommissioned from the German Navy at Kiel on May 10, 1945.
United States and France.
After the war ended, Z39 sailed with a mixed German and British crew to Wilhelmshaven, arriving at Plymouth, England, on July 6, 1945. The U.S. claimed her as a prize ship on July 12; she left England on July 30, arrived in Boston on August 7, and after extensive trials on September 14, the destroyer was commissioned into the U.S. Navy as DD-939. The U.S. Navy used the destroyer to test high-pressure steam propulsion systems; in November 1947, the U.S. Navy considered her obsolete and transferred her to the French Navy; after arriving at Casablanca in January 1948, she sailed to Toulon, where DD-939 was redesignated as Q-128 and later became the French destroyer Crebert (ex-Z6 Theodore Riedel), Hoche (ex-Z25), and Marceau (ex-Z31) were cannibalized for parts used in repairs. During her service in France, attempts to return her to active service were unsuccessful, and Q-128 was used as a pontoon for minesweepers near Brest until she was scrapped in 1964.
