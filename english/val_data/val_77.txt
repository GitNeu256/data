Mobile developed an export trade that placed the city third, after New York and New Orleans, in total value of exports for the nation by 1860. Since these exports consisted almost entirely of cotton destined for northern and foreign textile factories, Mobile, like other cotton ports, depended Page xiv upon northern businessmen for marketing services. Furthermore, Mobile relied on New York for almost all imports. Mobile had the worst export-import imbalance of all antebellum ports. 3 As the volume of cotton exports increased, so did the population of Mobile, from 1,500 in 1820 to 30,000 in 1860. During the rapid expansion of the boom 1820s and 1830s, many northerners and Englishmen migrated to Mobile to launch commercial firms. In the 1840s and 1850s large numbers of Irishmen and Germans arrived in Mobile to seek their fortunes. By that time many of the major businesses in the city were well established, and opportunities for newcomers were thus reduced. Destitute immigrants took low-paying unskilled labor positions anywhere they could find them in the city. Their entry into the work force displaced some free blacks and slaves from menial jobs. At the time of the Louisiana Purchase, the Mississippi River served as the boundary between West Florida and Louisiana, except for New Orleans. When France had settled the Gulf Coast, however, the eastern boundary of Louisiana extended to the Perdido River. After the cession of Louisiana, the United States claimed that the Perdido River was the eastern boundary of that portion of Louisiana located south of the thirty-first parallel. 33 Mobile, located in the disputed territory between the Perdido and Mississippi rivers, was placed into a United States Customs district in 1804.
