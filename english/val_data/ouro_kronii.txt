Profile
Name change
Kroniicha. It's me, it's perfect. It's also a synonym for ourokronii."
Time is unwaveringly precise, and its overseer, the Warden, is equally calm and impeccable.
At times, her exquisiteness leads to decisions and fortunes beyond human comprehension. But even perfection cannot gain a foothold in the face of disorder, her mortal enemy.
The Originals
A member of the Council, the Warden of Time, the third concept created by the gods and most closely associated with humanity.
No one escapes the sands of time; in fact, most humans do not even wish to be freed from its captivity. She picks up a blade almost reflexively and seems to enjoy it. Her quiet, aloof nature has not changed through the ages, but she has acquired a bit of haughtiness and sadistic tendencies in the process.
Originally, the concept of time was merely a cog, functioning only in conjunction with others.
Eventually, man gave time a discrete meaning, such as dawn or dusk, and made it universal. Instead of giving time power, man became a slave to time. In its present form, it has become a sadistic and haughty observer.
Personality.
Ouro Crony is extremely self-confident, egotistical, and not at all afraid of self-aggrandizement. However, he also self-describes that he is not generally a happy person, to the point of citing "existential dread" as a hobby. Clonie can be playful at times, especially with Clonie, and her withering humor combined with dry joke telling is in contrast to many of the other members, who are more outgoing or gentler with their words.
Her voice is strong and well-controlled, giving her a "big sister" vibe, but her actual personality is a bit closer to that of a "cool aunt" or a painfully relatable comic relief character. Her projected confidence and self-praise can be interpreted as a coping mechanism for the constant suffering she endures.
Clonie is generally self-conscious and actively attentive to her own mistakes. It was my fault" and "That was my fault" are phrases she often utters while playing. When she is damaged or killed in a game, she is quite explosive and vocal. She has a deep voice comparable to that of Mori Calliope, but she also has a wide vocal range, and has even produced a high-pitched voice at the request of viewers.
Celes Fauna describes Chronii as cool, funny, good at memes, and with a voice that she would like to have read to her every night in her sleep. She also describes him as having a considerable "gap moe," a cute side that he shows when he is upset, in contrast to his usual cool personality. Although the lore describes her as a haughty sadist, she is very kind to her chats and to her peers.
Her narcissism can sometimes creep up on her, and her advice to viewers is often jokingly "get better."
Hakos Baerz describes Crony as overly talented, savage, and a "tsundere grandmother."
Appearance.
She has short dark blue hair and blue eyes. Wears blue bow earrings.
Background
Upbringing.
Following the success of Hololive English in 2020 and 2021, COVER, Inc. announced that it will hold auditions for the second phase of English members from February 12 to March 26, 2021. Twitter accounts for the five new members were created in June 2021 and YouTube accounts on July 26, 2021.
In August 2021, a new generation of teaser videos began on Holive's official English YouTube channel: on August 1, "Prelude" revealed the story of the gods creating four concepts: space, nature, time, and civilization; on August 14, "Omen," these four concepts plus the primal forces of chaos was added to the creation of Avatar, and five silhouettes were revealed.On August 17, the "Council" unveiled the five new members of Holive English and announced their grand debut, scheduled for the end of next week. The new members, known to fans as "Holive English Generation 2," formed a group known as "-Council-," although the term "Generation" was not officially used.
At the conclusion of the Council's debut PV, the Twitter and YouTube accounts of all five new members were made public, and each tweeted for the first time. Twitter immediately restricted the accounts of Chronii and Mumyo Nanashi due to the rapid increase in followers.
On August 17, 2021, about 24 hours after the initial announcement, Aurocronii reached 100,000 YouTube subscribers before his debut. However, YouTube soon deleted about half of this number. Perhaps the rapid increase in subscribers on a channel that had no videos yet triggered YouTube's anti-bot algorithm; after reaching 200,000 YouTube subscribers for the first time, her subscriber count was again reduced.
Debut
Ouro Crony's debut was scheduled for Sunday, August 22. However, the debut of the "Council" was postponed for 24 hours due to unspecified technical problems. Members jokingly blamed it on the "curse of EN," which is said to be a tendency of members of Hollow Live English to suffer from unexpected technical problems. The debut was rescheduled for Sunday, August 22 (US/European time) or Monday, August 23 (Japan time) at the same time.
Clonie appeared on the debut stream on Monday, August 23 at 5:00 a.m. Japan time (August 22 at 1:00 p.m. or 9:00 p.m. EDT). She was the third debut for Holly. Her debut drew more than 90,000 viewers at its peak, and by the start of the stream, she had 115,000 YouTube subscribers. During the stream, Chronii performed a song and closed the stream by singing "Butterfly," the opening theme for the Japanese version of the anime "Digimon Adventure."
