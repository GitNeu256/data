Z38 was a Type 1936A (mob) destroyer built for the German Navy during World War II; it was broken ground in 1941 and completed two years later. Her anti-aircraft armament was substantially modified under the Barbara program. She was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 4, escorting task forces, patrolling, laying mines, and bombarding land-based units; after a short stint in the Baltic Sea in 1943, she was assigned to the Arctic Circle around Norway from 1943 to 1945, and again in the Baltic Sea in 1945.
After the war, she was taken over by the Royal Navy and renamed Nonsuch. After being used for extensive machine trials, she was used to test a 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) explosive mine, which damaged her keel and flooded her. The damage made refloating impossible and she was sold to Arnot Young on November 8, 1949 and scrapped.
Background
Intervellum.
After the end of World War I, Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles, which set strict limits on the size and displacement of warships it could possess. During the Interbellum period, the period between World War I and World War II, the average size of Allied ships and their armaments in almost all warship categories increased significantly. As a result of the treaty, Germany felt that its ships could not compete with those of the Allied navies and began to ignore the treaty, first in secret and later openly after Nazi Germany's Führer (dictator) Hitler publicly condemned it in March 1935. The drainage capacities of all German vessels at the time were deliberately understated in order to bring their official size into compliance with the Convention. Initially, these changes were made with the goal of matching or surpassing French and Polish destroyers, but later it became necessary for these destroyers to match the British destroyers.
Since the number of German shipyards was relatively small compared to the British and French, Germany adopted a policy of over-armament to compensate for the small number of destroyers by having them armed to the same standards as the French and Polish light cruisers. This resulted in several adverse effects, including reduced speed and excessive weight of the destroyers. German heavy destroyers had armament comparable to that of British light cruisers, but were far less seaworthy and far less equipped to control and use their guns.
Plan Z
Plan Z was a German naval rearmament program that began in 1939 and called for the construction of 10 battleships, 4 aircraft carriers, 12 battle cruisers, 3 pocket battleships, 5 heavy cruisers, 44 light cruisers, 68 destroyers, and 249 submarines. These ships were to form two battle fleets. The "Home Fleet" to hold the British fleet in the North Sea, and the "Raiding Fleet" to wage war on the British convoys. German Navy Grand Admiral Erich Raeder had been assured by Hitler that the war would not start until at least 1945. Rader wanted to extend the deadline for completion of Plan Z to 1948, but Hitler insisted on 1945. Privately, Hitler wanted to be at war with the Anglo-French alliance by 1942. World War II began in 1939, and few German heavy cruisers had been completed by that time. Germany's main naval enemies were France and Great Britain. Compared to the number of ships Germany had at the time of the war (in parentheses), it had 22 battleships (2), 7 aircraft carriers (zero), 22 heavy cruisers (4), 61 light cruisers (6), 255 destroyers (34), and 135 submarines (57, of which less than half could actually serve in the Atlantic or North Sea). Because of the enemy's clear superiority, Rader remarked that the German Navy could not hope for victory and would have to "die bravely." The Function of the Destroyer
The function of the destroyer was defined by its evolution: around the 1870s, nations that could not directly threaten the Royal Navy began investing in torpedo boats. Torpedo boats are small, agile vessels capable of inflicting enough damage with their torpedoes to pose a tactical problem to the enemy fleet; in the 20th century, British and German torpedo boats became larger, and a separate family of ocean-going torpedo boats, "torpedo boat destroyers" or simply destroyers, were built to counter them. The experience of World War I showed that destroyers rarely engaged mainline ships, but more often fought other destroyers and submarines. During the war, destroyers were used as "jack-of-all-trades," fulfilling virtually every role to some degree and participating in numerous operations, unlike the mainline ships, which rarely sailed during the war. By the end of the war, destroyers were recognized as one of the most useful naval classes.
During World War II, destroyers essentially performed the three basic functions of World War I: to serve as towing ships to protect their own fleet from the enemy fleet, to attack enemy towing ships, and to protect their own fleet from submarines. However, the introduction of anti-aircraft measures for destroyers became desirable, but many countries struggled to do so effectively. How destroyers were actually used varied from country to country. Germany did not use destroyers to defend against submarines. Hence, they did not have strong anti-submarine armaments. Instead, Germany relied on a large fleet of trawlers that were requisitioned and converted into minesweepers. British destroyers were built to escort the fleet, protect it from enemy aircraft, and sink submarines. German destroyers were built to escort the fleet or act as torpedo boats. The role of destroyers began to change more broadly as World War II progressed, with five parallel evolutions: all-purpose destroyers (all nations), anti-submarine destroyers (US and UK), anti-aircraft destroyers (Japan and UK), small destroyers (Germany and Italy), and super-size destroyers (France).
Design and Armament
The Z38 was 121.9 meters (400 feet) long at the draft line, 127 meters (417 feet) in length, 12 meters (39 feet) in beam, 6.6 meters (22 feet) in freeboard, and 4 meters (13 feet) in draft. Her standard load displacement was 3,083 tons (3,132 metric tons), and fully loaded, 3,691 tons (3,750 metric tons). She had a capacity of 332 persons, had 15 watertight compartments, and carried 825 tons (812 and 909 tons) of oil.
The armament of the Z38 before modification by the Barbara Project consisted of a 15-cm (5.9-inch) L/48 gun in the forward turret (200 rounds), three 15-cm (5.9-inch) L/48 guns in the forward turret (600 rounds), ten 2-cm (20,000 rounds) guns in the aft turret, four 3.7-cm anti-aircraft guns (8, The ship was also equipped with two 53.3cm quadruple torpedo tubes and 60 mines. After conversion, it carried 16 2cm guns and 6 3.7cm guns, while the rest of its armament remained unchanged.
The propulsion system consisted of six Wagner boilers that fed high-pressure superheated steam (70 atmospheres (1,029 psi; 7,093 kPa), 450°C) to two Wagner geared steam turbines. This gave her a rated output of 70,000 PS (51,000 kW, 69,000 hp) and a top speed of 38.5 knots (71.3 km/h, 44.3 mph). Her range was 2,239 nautical miles (4,147 km; 2,577 miles) and cruising speed was 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph).
The Z38's bridge was equipped with a FuMO 21 radar and four FuMB 4 Sumatra aerials were installed around the foremast searchlight platform. The forecastle had a degauss coil.
Commissioning History
Z38 was ordered on September 19, 1939, and was laid down in 1941 by Germaniawerft at G628 Arsenal in Kiel, launched on August 5, 1941, and commissioned on March 20, 1943 Z38 was immediately assigned to Destroyer Squadron 4.
In August 1943, Z38 served as a torpedo recovery boat for the training cruisers Nuremberg and Emden; on September 24, Z38, along with the German destroyers Z5 Paul Jacobi, Z14 Friedrich Ihn, Z15 Erich Steinbrinck, and Z27, escorted the They headed from Sasnitz to Trelleborg to escort Lützow.
On October 22, Z38 departed Swinemünde for Kaafjord; on December 25, a task force under Rear Admiral Erich Bey, consisting of the German battleship Scharnhorst and destroyers Z29, Z30, Z33, Z34, and Z38, was ordered to intercept Convoy JW55A, consisting of 19 ships. On December 26, Bey formed a patrol line with his destroyers. After returning the destroyers to base, Scharnhorst was spotted by a British cruiser and opened fire. In the ensuing Battle of the North Cape, Scharnhorst was sunk by the British fleet, including the British battleship Duke of York.
On May 30-31, 1944, Z29, Z33, Z34, and Z38 formed a patrol line between Bear Island and the North Cape; from June 30 to July 1, Z29, Z31, Z33, Z34, and Z38 sailed to Bear Island; on July 31, the German battleships Tirpitz, Z 29, Z31, Z33, Z34, and Z38 sailed from Alta Fjord to the Arctic Ocean for exercises; from October 21 to 31, Z29, Z31, Z33, Z34, and Z38 assisted in the evacuation of Mountain Troop Norway from around Murmansk to Norway; from November 6 to 17, Z31 , Z33, Z34, and Z38 covered German troops retreating from the Tana Fjord.
On January 22, 1945, Z31, Z34, and Z38 laid mines in Magerøya, Lahrfjord, and Blei Sounds; on January 25, Z31, Z34, and Z38 departed Tromsø for the Baltic Sea; on January 28, off Sognefjord, the three destroyers were intercepted by the light cruisers Diadem and Mauritius The three destroyers were intercepted by the British fleet, which included the light cruisers Diadem and Mauritius. During the battle, Z38's funnel caught fire and her boiler tube was damaged. After this, Z38 left the battle and headed for Kiel with Z34. There, Z38 received 200 coastal artillerymen and was transported to Gottenhafen.
From February 16 to 20, Z34, Z38, T5, and T6 escorted the passenger liner SS Hamburg to Sassnitz; on February 22, Z38 escorted the German steamer Deutschland to Sassnitz; on February 18 and 19, Z38, together with the German cruiser Admiral Scheer, destroyer Z43, and minesweepers T28 and T35, escorted the German cruiser Admiral Scheer to Sassnitz. On February 23, Z38, Z43, and T28 again shelled these locations. During this time, between Königsberg and Fischhausen, Z38 and T8 were iced and released by tugs; between March 4 and 6, Z38 shelled Soviet armor and positions near Wollin, then evacuated Pillau to Gotenhafen; on March 7, Z35, Z 38 and T28 escorted the steamer Pretoria to Copenhagen; on March 13, Z38 returned to Gotenhafen and shelled Großendorf; for the rest of March, Z38 was controlled by the Wehrmacht, not the German Navy; on April 4, her upper deck was damaged in an air raid; on April 5, Z38 was involved in fighting off Oxhöfter Kämpe; on April 9, Z38 escorted the German cruisers Lützow and Prinz Eugen from Danzig Bay to Swinemünde; from April 28 to May 4, Z38 helped defend the Dievenow channel of the Oder River; on May 5, Z38 was involved in an air raid on the Oder River.
On May 3, Z38 and Z39 escorted the battleship Schlesien, which struck a mine near Greifswalder Oie, to Swinemünde; on May 4, Z38 carried refugees from Svinemünde to Copenhagen. That same day, Z38 and T33 rescued the crew of the training ship Hector, which had been heavily damaged in an air raid; on May 7, Z38 returned to Swinemünde and transported more refugees to Copenhagen. On May 8, Z6, Z10, Z14, Z20, Z25, Z38, Z39, T17, T19, T23, T28, and T33 sailed from Hella to Glucksburg with 20,000 soldiers and civilians, arriving on May 9. On May 9, Z38 delivered the war diary to the After delivering it to the commander's house, it arrived in Kiel; on May 8, Z38 was decommissioned. At some point after decommissioning, Z38 was sailed to Wilhelmshaven by a mixed German and British crew, and on July 6, 1945, Z38 sailed to Portsmouth as a trial ship. The German crew remained aboard until September 22, 1946.
During her service in England, Z38 was renamed Nonsuch, her 11th ship name, and used for testing purposes; Z38 was initially given the pennant number R40, which was later changed to D107. Upon arrival in England, Z38 was used for various tests and evaluations in the Firth of Clyde before being laid up in the Creek at Port Chester. in October 1946, it was decided that Z38 would be commissioned for extensive mechanical testing and at the same time used as an air target ship under Commander Rosaïs. in January 1947, Z In September 1948, Z38 was scheduled to be inducted into the reserve fleet after the completion of trials in mid-October.
In December of the same year, it was decided that Z38 would be scrapped after showing off her auxiliary equipment to British shipbuilders and removing certain equipment. However, in March 1949, the Z38 was used for ship target trials in place of the Kimberley. After this decision, the Z38 was disarmed and towed to Lake Striven; in October 1949, the Z38 was placed on top of 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of explosives and exploded. The explosion sent up a plume of water 250 feet (76 meters) high and destroyed the keel about 1.6 seconds after the explosion. The second boiler room was flooded almost immediately, and the other two boiler rooms gradually filled with water. Z38 was then unloaded and, upon inspection, was determined to be too damaged to refloat, so she was delivered directly to the shipbuilder while still unloaded.
On November 8, 1949, Z38 was sold to Arnot Young for scrapping; by August 1950, the shipbreaker had removed the damaged parts and refloated the after-end. The after-end was taken to the breaker yard in Dalmuir for further inspection, while the fore-end was dismantled while laid up on the beach.
