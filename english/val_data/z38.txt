The Z38 was 127 meters long, had a beam of 12 meters, and a displacement of 3,600 tons. It was powered by two steam turbines, which gave it a top speed of 38.5 knots. The ship was armed with four 150-mm guns in four single turrets, eight 37-mm guns, nine 20-mm guns, and eight 533-mm torpedo tubes.
The Z38 was commissioned into the Kriegsmarine on August 15, 1942. It was initially assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, and it served in Norway and the North Atlantic. The ship saw action in several engagements, including the Battle of Barents Sea on December 31, 1942.
