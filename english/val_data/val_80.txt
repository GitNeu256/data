Two others believed involved in the theft, and also from Shreveport, have already been taken into custody.

The vacancy in the future opens again in the cover letter (the text that makes up the «body» of the letter when you send the resume), it is worth writing that you are aware that the vacancy is closed, but would like to report about your skills and experience in case. You may want to compose that you’ll be grateful if the HR manager will think about your candidacy for any other vacancies which can be within the ongoin company — which correspond to your experience and abilities.
