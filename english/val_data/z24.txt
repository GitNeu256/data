Z24 was one of 15 Type 1936A destroyers built for the German Navy during World War II. completed in 1940, she spent the first half of the war in Norwegian waters. in 1941-1942, she was very active in attacking arctic convoys carrying war materials to the Soviet Union. She herself only contributed to the sinking of one Allied ship.
After being rearmed in late 1942, Z24 was transferred to France, escorted Axis blockade runners through the Bay of Biscay in 1943, and played a small role in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay at the end of the year. After repairs were completed in early August, she was damaged by Allied fighter-bombers in mid-August. At the end of the same month, Z24 was again attacked by fighter-bombers and sunk.
Design and Features
The Type 1936A destroyer was slightly larger and heavier armed than the preceding Type 1936 class. It was 127 meters (416 feet 8 inches) long and 121.90 meters (399 feet 11 inches) long at the draft line. The beam was 12 meters (39 feet 4 inches) and the maximum draft was 4.62 meters (15 feet 2 inches). The ship weighed 2,603 tons (2,645 metric tons) when standard loaded and 3,605 tons (3,663 metric tons) when deep loaded. two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, used steam supplied by six Wagner water tube boilers to generate 70,000 PS ( The Z24 was designed to generate 51,000 kW (51,000 kW, 69,000 shp) and had a design speed of 36 knots (67 km/h, 41 mph). z24 could carry up to 791 tons (779 t) of fuel oil and travel 2,500 nautical miles (4,600 km, 2, 900 miles) at 19 knots (35 km/h, 22 mph). 900 miles) range. The crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors.
She was armed with one 15cm TbtsK C/36 cannon forward of the superstructure and three aft. Antiaircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm C/30 guns mounted on two mounts next to the rear funnel and five 2 cm C/30 guns on a single mount; Z24 carried eight overwater 53.3 cm torpedo tubes on two powered mounts. Two reloads were provided on each mount. The aft deck was also equipped with a mine track that could carry up to 60 mines. A "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) passive hydrophone was fitted to detect submarines and probably also S-Gerät sonar. The upper bridge was equipped with a FuMO 21 radar.
Modifications
The Z24's forward 15cm single gun was replaced by a 15cm LC/38 turret during a refit at the end of 1942. This worsened the Type 36A's tendency to land on her bow and reduced her speed to 32.8 knots (60.7 km/h, 37.7 mph). Around the same time, the Z24 was fitted with a pair of quadruple 2cm guns and three single 2cm guns, for a total of 16 2cm guns. Later a FuMB 1 Metox radar detector was added, and when she docked at Brest, France, in June 1944, a single quadruple 2cm gun replaced the single 2cm gun that had previously been mounted in the middle of the ship.
History of commissioning
Z24 was ordered from AG Weser (Deschimag) on April 23, 1938; she was broken ground on January 2, 1939 at the Bremen shipyard in Deschimag under yard number W958, launched on March 7, 1940, and commissioned on October 23. After commissioning, Z24 began escorting ships between the Baltic Sea and Norway in March 1941; on June 12-13, Z24 was one of the escorts of the heavy cruiser Lützow as it attempted to sail into the Atlantic. Several Bristol Beaufort planes spotted Lützow and her escort off Norway, and one of them hit the cruiser with a torpedo in a surprise attack early on June 13, forcing Lützow to return to Germany for repairs. Z24, along with her sister ship Z23, was transferred to Brest on the 16th, helped escort the battleship Scharnhorst through the Bay of Biscay from 20 to 24 July, and covered the merchant ship Orion through the same bay from 21 to 28 August; on 23 October she was ordered to northern Norway.
At the end of November, she arrived in Tromsø and was assigned to the 8th Destroyer Squadron; on 17 December, Z24, along with her sisters Z23, Z25, and Z27, sailed into the Barents Sea on 16 December 1941, searching for Allied vessels off the Kola Peninsula. The next day, Z25's radar spotted two ships at a distance of 37.5 kilometers (23.3 miles) in a thick fog. The Germans thought they were Soviet destroyers, but in fact they were two British minesweepers, Hazard and Speedy, which were sailing to rendezvous with Convoy QP 6. The Germans intercepted them, but were unable to fire accurately due to thick fog and icing. Despite four hits on Speedy and a large expenditure of ammunition, the British ships were able to escape; on January 13, 1942, Z25 escorted Z23 and Z24 to lay minefields in the West Channel of the White Sea. A week later, on January 20, Z23 accidentally collided with Z24 in thick fog, forcing Z24 to return to Wesermünde for repairs.
Anti-convoy operations
Upon completion, the Z24 escorted the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper to Norway on March 18. Ten days later, Z24 and her sister ships Z25 and Z26 departed Varangerfjord to intercept Convoy PQ13. Late that night, they rescued the 61 survivors of the sunken freighter SS Empire Ranger and later sank the stray 4,687 gross ton (GRT) freighter SS Bateau. The ship rescued seven survivors before resuming the search for the convoy. The light cruiser HMS Trinidad, escorted by the destroyer HMS Fury, spotted the German ship on radar at 08:49 on the 29th and was herself spotted at the same time. Both sides opened fire at close range at 3,200 yards (2,900 meters) in a blizzard. Trinidad engaged the German destroyer Z26 and inflicted heavy damage. Meanwhile, the destroyer fired 19 torpedoes at the cruiser, but all missed after Trinidad turned away, hitting it twice with her 15cm guns but causing only minor damage. The British ship maneuvered to avoid the torpedoes and was forced to break away, and Z26 accidentally became separated from her sisters. Trinidad and Fury pursued Z26 and inflicted further damage, but Trinidad was disabled in combat by her own torpedo.
The destroyer HMS Eclipse began the pursuit after Fury turned away to assist the cruiser. After the sixth hit by the British destroyer, Z26 lost power at 10:20, soaked her stern and tilted to port. Eclipse maneuvered to finish off the German destroyer with a torpedo, but when the blizzard ended and visibility cleared, she saw Z24 and Z25 approaching. at 10:35, before she had time to duck under a squall, Z24 and Z25 opened fire on Eclipse, hitting her twice and wounding nine men. The German ships did not put Eclipse in perth and attempted to separate the 88 survivors from Z26.
Reinforced by Z7 Hermann Schoemann and assigned to Zerstörergruppe Arktis (Destroyer Group Arctic) commanded by Kapitän zur See (Captain) Alfred Schulze-Hinrichs, the two destroyers were assigned on April 11 to convoys PQ 14 and QP 10, but were unsuccessful; on April 30, the German submarine U-456 torpedoed and sank the light cruiser Edinburgh, which was part of the close escort of convoy QP 11, rendering it unseaworthy. Later that day, three destroyers were ordered to intercept the ship. The next afternoon they encountered the main convoy of transports and attacked them with limited visibility. For the next four hours, they attempted to approach the convoy five times, but the four escorting British destroyers were able to stay between the Germans and the convoy. Rejected, Schulze-Hinrichs decided to abort the attack and look for its original objective. The German ships sank the 2,847 GRT freighter SS Ziolkowski with Z24 and Z25 torpedoes and only inflicted heavy damage on the escort destroyer Amazon with their gunfire. The British ships did not hit the German destroyers.
Later that day, Edinburgh's escort, consisting of two destroyers, was augmented by four British minesweepers and one small Russian tugboat. With the tugboats steering, the cruiser was underway under her own power by the morning of May 2 at a speed of about 3 knots (5.6 km/h, 3.5 mph). The Germans spotted her and the Z7 Hermann Scheman exchanged fire with the minesweeper Harrier at about 06:27. Edinburgh then stopped towing and increased her speed to a maximum of about 8 knots (15 km/h), turning and steering Z7 Hermann Schoemann to a range of 2,800 m. When the range approached 2,800 m, she was able to get into a good position to fire a torpedo at a speed of 21 knots (39 km/h, 24 At 06:36, the cruiser opened fire and the first shot missed by only about 100 meters (110yd). The destroyer immediately turned away, increased speed to 31 knots (57 km/h), and began to smoke, but the second shot caught fire and cut the main steam line, rendering the engine unusable Z25 engaged the destroyer Forrester first, hitting her three times around 06:50, disabling two guns, the forward boiler room was hit, disabling power. A few minutes later, the sister ship Foresight passed in front of Forester, attracting the attention of Z24 and Z25, which succeeded admirably, hitting her four times by 07:24, disabling her engines and leaving her with only one gun. Meanwhile, the cruiser was hit by another torpedo at 07:02, but it only destroyed the engine and gave a list to port; Z24 and Z25 were drifting, despite occasional British shells, rather than sinking the three disabled British ships and the lightly armed minesweeper, Z7 Hermann Scherman Z24 and Z25 concentrated on rescuing the crew of Z7 Hermann Schoemann, which was adrift despite occasional British shells. z7 Hermann Schoemann was then roared down using her own bombs. z24 was unharmed during the battle, but z 25 was hit once.
The ship took part in the outpost of Operation Rösselsprung in early July, which attempted to intercept Convoy PQ 17. Admiral Lützow and his sister, Admiral Scheer, along with Z24 and her four sisters, formed one group at Narvik, while Admiral Hipper and the battleship Tirpitz formed another group. On the way to the rendezvous at Alta Fjord, three destroyers escorting Lützow and Tirpitz ran aground, forcing the entire group to abandon the operation; on July 12, Z24 escorted one of the damaged destroyers to Kiel, then to Wesermünde for a lengthy The refit began.
Operations in France
On March 5, 1943, 8. Zersteller Flottere (Z23, Z24, Z32, Z37) moved to the Atlantic coast of France via the English Channel in Operation Karin. Despite attacks by British coastal artillery and motor torpedo boats, the flotilla was able to pass through the Strait of Dover unscathed, but Z37 ran aground at Le Havre en route. The flotilla provided distant cover for the Italian blockade ship Himalaya as she attempted to sail to the Far East on March 28, but had to return to Bordeaux when she was spotted by British scouts. two days later, the flotilla escorted the Italian blockade ship Pietro Orseolo in the Bay of Biscay, but the ship was torpedoed by American submarines and heavily attacked by Bristol Beaufighter fighter-bombers and Beaufort torpedo bombers. The German destroyer shot down five attack planes. Himalaya attempted another breakout on April 9, but was spotted by a Short Sunderland flying boat. After reversing course, it was attacked by Vickers Wellington bombers and Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers. Five of the attacking aircraft were shot down.On 14 June, Z24 and Z32 sortied into the Bay of Biscay to detach the survivors of the sunken German submarine U-564, which had been rescued by U-185. The fleet escorted submarines through the bay throughout the summer; from December 24 to 26, it was one of the escorts of the 6,951 GRT blockade ship MV Osorno through the Bay of Biscay.
The other blockade-runner, MV Alsterwoofer (2,729 GRT refrigerated cargo ship), followed Osorno a few days later, and on December 27, four destroyers, including Z24 of 8. Flotilles, and six torpedo boats from 4. Torpedoboot Flotilles (4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla) sailed to escort Osorno through the bay. They escorted the ship. The Allies, aware of the presence of these blockade flotillas through Ultra's code-breaking activities, deployed cruisers and aircraft in the western Atlantic to intercept them in Operation Stonewall. Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers of the Royal Air Force's 311th Squadron sank the Ulster Ufer late that afternoon, and around noon on December 28, the British cruisers Glasgow and Enterprise, which were on patrol in the Bay of Biscay, intercepted German destroyers and torpedo boats to intercept the blockade runners and causing the Battle of the Bay. With heavy seas, the Germans were unable to demonstrate their theoretical advantage of speed and firepower, and destroyer Z27 and torpedo boats T25 and T27 were sunk; Z24 did not engage the British cruisers or fire her weapons, and suffered engine trouble during the battle.
She began her refit at La Pallis on January 14, 1944, which was completed in early May, and on June 6, upon receiving news of the Allied landings at Normandy, 8. Zersteller Fleet commander Theodor von Bechtolsheim ordered the three remaining destroyers Z24, Z32, and ZH1, and torpedo boat T24, to Brest. The three remaining destroyers, Z24, Z32, ZH1, and torpedo boat T24, were ordered to sail to Brest and begin operations against the invasion fleet. While underway they were attacked by Beaufighters, with Z32 damaged by two rockets and one forced to abandon ship. Upon arriving at Brest, Z24 and Z32 reinforced their anti-aircraft suits, and on the night of June 8 and 9, the four ships departed Brest for Cherbourg, only to be intercepted by eight Allied destroyers of the 10th Destroyer Squadron at the Battle of Ushant. The German ships were spotted first, so the British opened fire first, and the Germans returned fire with four torpedoes from each destroyer, which missed as the Allied ships turned to evade. The bombardment was so effective that the Z24 was badly damaged shortly after the first salvo. Because of the very close range, both sides engaged with 40mm or 37mm anti-aircraft guns, which greatly increased the damage suffered by the Z24. The Allied ships hit the German destroyer with five 4.7-inch (120 mm) shells before it smoked out and broke away. The first shell hit the turret's 15-centimeter loading chamber, cutting off communication with the turret, and another shell devastated the forward superstructure, killing 13 men and setting fire to the radio room. Another shell hit the forward engine room, igniting the aft funnel and some ready ammunition and destroying one of the midship's four 2cm gun mounts; two Canadian destroyers pursued the Z24 and T24 until the German ships passed the minefield.
While under repair in Bordeaux from 13 July to 5 August, she was attacked by Allied fighter-bombers off Royan on the 14th; she was hit by five rockets and 90 20mm shells, damaging her superstructure and turret; Z24 returned to Bordeaux for repairs, but on 24 August Z24 was attacked by rocket-propelled Beaufighters off Le Verdon-sur-Mer. She was hit three times in this attack, killing one and wounding another. The next day, she managed to berth on shore, but then capsized and sank. Her crew was transferred to the garrison of Festung Gironde (Gironde Fortress), which held out until the German surrender in May 1945.
