COVID-19 is a contagious respiratory illness caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. The virus spreads through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from mild to severe. Some common symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle aches, headache, sore throat, and loss of taste or smell. In some cases, COVID-19 can lead to more serious complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death.
There is no specific treatment for COVID-19. Treatment is supportive and may include rest, fluids, over-the-counter pain relievers, and oxygen therapy. In some cases, hospitalization may be required.
