Mixed martial arts career
Early career
Baczynski began fighting in 2006, making his debut at a Rage in the Cage event. Baczynski lost the fight to Shane Johnson via kneebar submission in round one. Baczynski bounced back from the loss and won three straight fights, all for Rage in the Cage.
International Fight League
He then signed a contract with the International Fight League. He debuted for the promotion against Brent Beauparlant, losing via decision. He was given a second chance, and fought Dan Molina. The fight ended with Baczynski, again, on the losing end. Baczynski was released from the IFL after the loss.
Post-IFL
Baczynski obtained a 7–1 record after being released from the IFL. He then fought up and comer Roger Bowling, losing by vicious KO only nine seconds into round one. Baczynski won a fight against Tom Nguyen at a Wild Bill's Fight Night event. He was then selected to be a part of The Ultimate Fighter.
The Ultimate Fighter
Baczynski was selected as one of the 28 competitors for the eleventh season of the Ultimate Fighter. To get onto the show and become one of the 14 fighters, Baczynski had to fight Court McGee. After three rounds, the judges awarded the win to McGee, sending Baczynski home.
After a fighter was injured and forced out of the competition, Baczynski was given the injured fighter's spot. In his first fight back he fought Team Liddell's last pick, Joseph Henle. Baczynski won the fight via three round unanimous decision and moved onto the quarter-final round.
In the quarter-final round, Baczynski faced rival team member and friend Brad Tavares. As the first round ended, Baczynski threw an illegal soccer kick to the head of Tavares. Baczynski immediately apologized, knowing he could have seriously hurt Tavares, who went to his corner and slumped. After discussing the matter with the doctors, Herb Dean stopped the fight and Tavares was declared the winner by disqualification, advancing him to the semi-finals.
In 2017, he returned to TUF 25, ultimately losing by unanimous decision to Gilbert Smith.
Ultimate Fighting Championship
Baczynski made his UFC debut in a rematch against Brad Tavares at The Ultimate Fighter: Team Liddell vs. Team Ortiz Finale. After three close rounds, Baczynski lost the fight via unanimous decision (29–28, 29–28, 29–28).
Due to his loss to Tavares, Baczynski was subsequently released from the UFC.
Post-UFC
Soon after being released from the UFC, Baczynski was reportedly signed by Strikeforce and was scheduled to make his promotional debut at ShoMMA 10: Riggs vs. Taylor against Erik Apple. However, Apple was forced to pull out of the fight and a replacement was not named.
He then fought UFC and WEC veteran, Tim McKenzie, at Tachi Palace Fights 7. The fight was ended after Baczynski escaped from a near fight ending armbar submission hold, which ended up breaking his arm, and knocked McKenzie out with elbows. McKenzie appealed the result to the CSAC.
On April 9, 2011, Baczynski became the Interim Ringside MMA Welterweight Champion when he TKO'd formerly undefeated prospect Alex Garcia at Ringside MMA 10.
