Reddit is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Registered users submit content to the site, such as links, text posts, images, and videos, which are then voted up or down by other users. The site is organized into thousands of subreddits, each of which is devoted to a particular topic or interest. 
Reddit was founded in 2005 by Steve Huffman, Alexis Ohanian, and Aaron Swartz. The site quickly gained popularity, and by 2015, it had over 100 million active users. Reddit is now one of the most popular websites in the world.
Reddit users can upvote or downvote content, and the content that receives the most upvotes rises to the top of the subreddit. This system helps to ensure that the most popular and relevant content is seen by the most people.
Reddit users can also comment on content, and these comments are organized by time. This allows users to have conversations about the content that they are interested in.
