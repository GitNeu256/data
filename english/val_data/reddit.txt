Reddit is an American social news aggregation, content evaluation, and discussion website. Registered users (commonly referred to as "redditors") send content such as links, text posts, images and videos to the site and are voted up and down by other members. Posts are organized by subject on a user-created board called "communities" or "subreddits". Submissions with more votes will appear at the top of the subreddit, and if you receive enough votes, they will eventually appear on the front page of the site. Reddit administrators manage the community. Moderation is also done by community-specific moderators who are not Reddit employees. It is operated by Reddit Inc.The company is based in San Francisco.
According to Semrush, as of 2023/2, Reddit is ranked as the 10th most visited website in the world and the 6th most visited website in the United States. About 42-49.3% of its user base comes from the US, followed by the UK at 7.9–8.2% and Canada at 5.2-7.8%. 18% of U.S. adults aged 29 to 22, and 30% of U.S. adults aged 49 to 14 use Reddit regularly.
Reddit was founded in 2005 by University of Virginia roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, along with Aaron Swartz. Condé Nast Publications acquired the site in 2006-10. In 2011, Reddit became an independent subsidiary of Advance Publications, the parent company of Condé Nast. In 2014/10, Reddit raisedド5000 million in a fundraising round led by Sam Altman, which includes investors Marc Andreessen, Peter Thiel, Ron Conway, Snoop Dogg and Jared Leto. Their investment valued the company at当時500 million at the time. In 2017, Reddit raisedReddit7 billion at a valuation ofま1.8 billion, with prior publications remaining in the majority of stakeholders.2 In 2019, a資金調達2 billion financing round led by Tencent brought the company's valuation toン3.30 billion. In 2021/8, a資金調達7 billion financing round led by Fidelity Investments raised its valuation to more than1100 billion. After that, the company reportedly filed for an IPO in 2021-12 with a valuation ofド150 billion.
Reddit has received praise for many of its features, including the ability to create some subreddits for a niche community, and Reddit's publicity for many causes has attracted negative attention for its tendency to spread potentially dangerous misinformation.
History
See Reddit's timeline for a chronological guide.
Reddit's idea and initial development came from college roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian in 2005, when they attended a lecture by programmer and entrepreneur Paul Graham in Boston, Massachusetts, on spring break from the University of Virginia. After speaking with Huffman and Ohanian after the lecture, Graham invited two people to apply to his startup incubator Y Combinator. Their initial idea, my mobile menu, failed and was intended to allow users to order food via SMS text messaging. During a brainstorming session to pitch another startup, the idea was created for what Graham called the "front page of the Internet." For this idea, Huffman and Ohanian were accepted in the first class of Y Combinator. With financial support from Y Combinator, Huffman coded the site in Common Lisp and with Ohanian launched Reddit in 2005/6. Embarrassed by the site that looks empty, the founder has created hundreds of fake users to make the post look more populous, even if you don't want to strategy it.
The team expanded to include Christopher Slowe in 2005-11. Between 2005/11 and 2006/1, Reddit merged with Aaron Swartz's company Infogami, making Swartz not a bug, but an equivalent owner of the resulting parent company. Ohanian later wrote that instead of labeling Swartz as a co-founder, the correct explanation was that Swartz's company was acquired by Reddit, which he and Huffman started when Huffman and Ohanian sold Reddit to Wired owner Condé Nast Publications in 2006 for110.31 million toCond10.20 million, and the team moved to San Francisco. He moved to Lansisco. In 2006-11, Swartz complained about the new corporate environment and criticized its productivity levels. In 2007, Schwartz was fired for undisclosed reasons on May 1.
Huffman and Ohanian left Reddit in 2009. Huffman co-founded Hipmunk with Adam Goldstein, and later recruited Ohanian and Slowe to the new company. After Huffman and Ohanian left Reddit, Erik Martin, who joined in 2008 as a community manager and became General Manager in 2011, played a role in Reddit's growth. VentureBeat stated that Martin is "responsible for maintaining the site" under the ownership of Condé Nast. Martin promoted the purchase of Reddit gifts and led the charity initiative.
Reddit started in 2009 with 2 different advertising methods on the site. The company launched its sponsored content and self-service advertising platform that year. Reddit launched the Reddit Gold benefits program in 2010-7, offering editors new features and creating new revenue streams for businesses that don't rely on banner ads. In 2011/9/6, Reddit was operationally independent from Condé Nast and operated as a separate subsidiary of its parent company, Advance Publications. Reddit and other websites participated in the site-wide blackout on January18, 2012, in protest at the stop online piracy act 12. In 2012/5, Reddit joined the Internet Defense League, a group formed to organize future protests.
Yishan Wong joined Reddit in 2012 as CEO. Wong resigned from Reddit in 2014, citing disagreements over a proposal to move the company's office from San Francisco to nearby Daily City, as well as the "stress and drainage" nature of the position. Ohanian believed in Wong's new success as his user base grew from 3,500 million to 17,400 million. Wong oversaw the company as it raised資金5000 million in funding and spun off as an independent company. Also, during this time, Reddit began accepting Bitcoin, the digital currency of the Reddit Gold subscription service, in 2013 through a partnership with bitcoin payment processor Coinbase on May 2. Ellen Pao replaced wong as interim CEO in 2014 and resigned in 2015 amid a user revolt over the dismissal of a popular Reddit employee. During her tenure, Reddit launched an anti-harassment policy, banning involuntary sexualization and banning several forums focused on biased content and harassment of individuals.
After Wong resigned in 2014-11, Ohanian and Huffman returned to leadership roles on reddit, and in 2015, 7-10, with Pao's resignation, Huffman returned to the company's chief executive. After Huffman returned to REDDIT as CEO, he launched Reddit's iOS and Android apps, improved Reddit's mobile website and created A/B test infrastructure. The company launched a massive redesign of its website in 2018/4. Huffman said the new user was turned off from Reddit because it looked like a "dystopian craigslist." Reddit will also hide posts, comments, and private messages from selected redditors in an attempt to curb online harassment by such users.These new content guidelines were aimed at banning content that incites violence and isolating offensive material. Slowe, the company's first employee, re-entered Reddit in 2017 as Chief Technology Officer. Reddit's biggest fundraising round took place in 2017 when it raisedド2 billion and was valued atン1.8 billion. The funds helped redesign the Reddit site and video initiatives.
In 2020, Ohanian resigned as a member of the board of Directors in response to George Floyd's protest, demanding that he be replaced "by a black candidate." 6-5 Then Michael Seibel, CEO of y Combinator, was named to the board.
In 2020/12/13, Reddit announced that it had acquired short-form video social platform Dubsmash with the aim of integrating video creation tools into Reddit, hiring an entire team.
In 2021/35, Reddit announced that it had appointed Drew Vollero, who worked for Snapchat's parent company Snap (SNAP), as its first chief financial officer a few weeks after the site came into the limelight for its role in GameStop's trading frenzy. Bolero's appointment spurred speculation of an initial public offering that senior leaders have publicly considered.
In 2021/12, Reddit revealed that it secretly filed an initial public offering with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In 2022/6, Reddit acquired MeaningCloud, a natural language processing company.
In 2022/9, Reddit acquired Spiketrap for an undisclosed amount.
Fidelity, the lead investor in Reddit's fundraising round in 2023-4, 2021, has cut its investment in Reddit cumulatively by 41%. It was revealed in the monthly disclosure that Fidelity valued its stake at down16.6 million, down from an initial investment of down28.2 million, which had valued the company at down10 billion following the announcement of plans to lay off 6% of Reddit employees in 2023 and reduce the number of scheduled jobs that year.
In 2023/6, the BlackCat hacker gang claimed responsibility for a 2023/2 breach of Reddit's system. On their data leak site, they claimed to have stolen 80GB of compressed data and demanded a身代金450 million ransom from Reddit. The attack did not include data encryption like a typical ransomware campaign.
Site Overview
Reddit consists of user-generated content, such as photos, videos, links, and text-based posts, and essentially a discussion of this content on the bulletin board system, the name "Reddit" is a word of play with the phrase "read", that is, "read on Reddit." According to Reddit, in 2019, there were about 43,000 million monthly users known as "redditors." The site's content is divided into categories or communities called "subredits" on the site, of which more than 138,000 active commissars Notable subreddits include r/centuryclub, which only Reddit users with 100k+ posts or comment karma can participate, and r/centuryclub, which only Reddit users with 100k+ posts or comment karma can participate. This includes r/freekarma4u where users give each other free upvotes.
As a network of communities, Reddit's core content is made up of posts from users. Users can continue the conversation by commenting on other people's posts. An important feature of Reddit is that users can cast positive or negative votes for each post and comment on the site, called upvotes and downvotes, respectively. The number of Upvotes or downvotes determines the visibility of posts on the site, so the most popular content is visible to most people. Users can also earn "karma" for their posts and comments, status that reflects their status within the community and their contribution to Reddit. Posts may be automatically archived after 6 months, so you won't be able to comment or vote.
The most popular posts from the site's numerous subreddits appear on the front page to those who browse the site without an account. By default for these users, the front page will show the subreddit r/popular, with all the top ranked posts on Reddit. The Subreddit r/all originally did not filter topics, but as of 2021, it does not contain any unsafe content for work. Subscribe to Subreddits Registered users can see the top content of subreddits they subscribe to on their personal front page. In addition, some subreddit have karma and account age requirements to prevent bots and spammers from posting.
Front page rank — for both the general front page and individual subreddit - includes a combination of factors including age of submission, positive ("upvoted") negative ("downvoted") feedback ratio, and total number of votes.
Users and Moderators
Registering an account on Reddit is free and requires an email address. In addition to commenting and voting, registered users can also create their own subreddit on the topic of their choice. In Reddit style, the username starts with "u/". For example, notable redditors include u/Poem_For_Your_Sprog, which responds to Reddit's entire message with poetry, u/Shitty_Watercolour, which responds to posts and posts pictures, u/gallowboob, which has the second highest karma on Reddit, Reddit's CEO (Steve Huffman), u/DeepFuckingValue, and redditor, which has the most award-winning karma. .
Subreddit is overseen by moderators, Reddit users who earn titles by creating subredits or being promoted by current moderators. Reddit users can also request r/redditrequest to moderate a sub that has no moderator or a very inactive sub. These requests will be confirmed by the Reddit administrator. Moderators are volunteers who manage the community, set and enforce community-specific rules, remove posts and comments that violate these rules, and generally maintain discussions on subreddit on topics. In contrast, administrators are paid to work on Reddit.
Reddit also releases a transparency report each year that includes information such as the number and reason of posts deleted by moderators. It also details information about requests made by law enforcement agencies to remove information and content about users. In 2020, Reddit removed 6% of the posts made on the platform (about 100%). 2.33 million). More than 99% of the deletes were marked as spam, and the rest consisted of a combination of other offensive content. About 13,100 million posts were deleted by automatic moderators and the rest were manually deleted.
Reddit moderators are estimated to have a total of 466 hours of work each day, which amounts to up to3340 million in unpaid work each year. This is roughly equivalent to 2.8% of the company's annual revenue.
Subredits
"r/" is redirected here. For other uses, see /r/ (disambiguation).
Subreddits (officially called communities) are areas of interest created by users in which discussions about Reddit are organized. As of 2018/7, there are about 138,000 active subreddit (total 120 million). For example, "r/science" is a community for discussing scientific publications, "r/gaming" is a community for discussing video games, and "r/worldnews" is a community for posting news stories from around the world.
In an interview with Memeburn in 2014, Erik Martin, Reddit's general manager, said, "The approach is to give community moderators and curators as much control as possible to shape and nurture the type of community they want." Subreddit is a visual styling for the community and often uses a theme variant of Reddit's alien mascot, Snoo.
Other Features
Reddit Premium (formerly Reddit Gold) is a premium membership that allows users to view the site without ads. If other users specifically rate comments or posts, they can also give coins to users, generally for humorous or high-quality content. Reddit Premium includes exclusive subreddits such as comment highlighting, r/lounge, personalized Snoo (known as "snoovatar"), and the Reddit premium trophy that can be displayed on users' profiles, and regular users Reddit Gold was renamed Reddit Premium in 2018. In addition to gold coins, users can gift silver and platinum coins to other users as a reward for quality content.
On the site, redditors commemorate "Cake Day" 1 time a year, on the anniversary of the day the account was created. Cake Day adds a small slice of cake icon next to the user's name for 24 hours.
In 2021/8, the company introduced short-format video features like TikTok for iOS that allow users to quickly swipe through feeds of short video content. In 2021/12, the company introduced a Spotify-wrapped-like feature called Reddit Recap, which summarizes various statistics about each user from 1/1 to 11/30.Make it available for users to view, including the time they spend on Reddit, the communities they participate in, and the topics they engage in.
In 2022/7/7, Reddit announced "blockchain-backed Collectible Avatars," a customizable avatar available on the subreddit r/CollectibleAvatars for purchase separately from reddit Premium. Avatars were created by independent artists who post their work on other subreddits and receive a portion of the profit. They are using Reddit's Polygon blockchain-powered digital wallet The Vault. Richard Lawler of The Verge described them as "non-alternative tokens (Nft) that can be purchased with Reddit avatar builder."
Chat function
In 2017, Reddit developed its own real-time chat software for the site. While some established subreddits use third-party software to chat about the community, the company has built a chat feature in hopes of becoming an integral part of Reddit. Individual chat rooms were rolled out in 2017, and community chat rooms for specific subreddit members were rolled out in 2018.
The Reddit talk was announced as a competitor to Clubhouse in 2021/4. Reddit talk allows subreddit moderators to start an audio conference room that mimics the clubhouse in design. In 2022, reddit Talk was updated to support recording audio rooms and working with the web version of Reddit. The desktop app is reportedly scheduled for release in late May 2.
Deprecated features
The Reddit Public Access Network, popularly known as RPAN, was a live streaming service run by Reddit. Viewers interacted with the stream by voting for or against it, chatting and giving paid awards. During off-air hours, 24/7 streaming was possible to dedicated subreddits, but with limited slots and features. In 2019/8/19, Reddit announced RPAN. It was said to be under test, but they were experimenting with making it a permanent program and how to increase the platform's revenue. Then the 5-day test period began. During the testing period, streaming was for a specific group of users, capable of streaming 1 30 minutes per person and 100 slots. In 2020/7/1, RPAN Studio, an application that allows users to broadcast live from desktop computers, was released. RPAN Studio is built on top of OBS, an open source streaming and recording program. In 2021/1/28, Reddit has permanently increased its streaming time to 3 hours. RPAN was officially discontinued in 2022-11-15.
In 2019, Reddit tested a new feature that allows users to tip others. This was only available for a user named Chris who goes by the alias u/shittymorph, who was known for posting well-written comments, but only for ending with the same copy pasta referring to the Hell cell match between the 1998 wrestlers The Undertaker and Mankind. .
Technology and Design
The underlying code
Reddit was originally written in Common Lisp, but was rewritten in Python in 2005-12 due to wider access to the code library and development flexibility. The Python web framework that Swartz developed to run the site,web.py As of 2009-11-10, Reddit was using Pylons as a web framework. Reddit was an open source project from 2008-6-18 to 2017. In the meantime, all the code and libraries written for Reddit were freely available on GitHub, with the exception of the anti-spam/cheating part. In its 2017/9 announcement, the company said it "has done a bad job of keeping open source product repositories up to date," but one of the reasons is that "open source makes it harder to "clearly" develop some features."1 Without leaking our plans too far," prompted the decision to archive the public GitHub repository.
Hosting and Servers
As of 2009-11-10, Reddit removed the servers it owned and migrated to Amazon Web Services, using EC2 for application services and S3 for storage. Reddit uses postgresql as its primary data store. As part of a more data-driven effort, Reddit built a data analytics pipeline on top of Apache Kafka and Hive as a data warehouse. We use Amazon's Elastic MapReduce to run Hadoop workloads across Hive, store the results in S3, and eventually place the data in Amazon RDS for visualization purposes. It also uses HAProxy for load balancing and Jenkins and Apache Pig for data pipelines. Reddit uses Redis and its HyperLogLog implementation to cache approximate page views in the underlying Apache Cassandra cluster for persistence. For general caching and memoization of queries, Reddit uses memcached behind mcrouter, facebook's memcached router.memcached behind facebook's memcached router. In 2017, 54 EC2 instances dedicated to the cache split approximately 3.3 terabytes of memory into different pools. Reddit's service is made up around a common foundation named Baseplate. It was originally implemented in Python, but since 2019 some of it has been reimplemented in Go to improve performance. Reddit also runs its service thorugh Kubernetes and uses Spinnaker for continuous delivery.
In early 2009, Reddit started using jQuery. In 2017, Reddit announced that it had adopted TypeScript to redesign its UI.
There are a lot of iterations on Reddit's search feature and we are currently implementing it using Lucidworks Fusion.
Mobile App
In 2010, Reddit released the first mobile web interface for easy-to-read navigation of websites on touch-screen devices. For several years, redditors relied on third-party apps to access Reddit on their mobile devices. In 2014, Reddit acquired 10 of them, Alien Blue, which became the official iOS Reddit app.1 Reddit removed Alien Blue and released the official application Reddit: The Official App on Google Play and iOS App Store in 2016/4. The company released an app for Reddit questions and answers in 2014 ask me anything subreddit. This app was able to see users actively ask me Anythings, receive notifications, ask questions and vote.
Product and Design Changes
The site has undergone several product and design changes since it was first launched in 2005. When it first launched, there were no comments or subreddits. Comments were added in 2005, and interest-based groups (called "subreddits") were introduced in 2008. Allowing users to create subreddits has resulted in many of the activities redditors perceive to help define Reddit. These include subreddits "WTF", "funny", and "AskReddit". Reddit rolled out its multireddit feature in 2013, the biggest change to the site's front page in years. Multireddits allows users to see the top stories from the collection of subreddits.
In 2015, Reddit enabled embedding, as a result of which users could share Reddit content on other sites. In 2016, Reddit started hosting images using a new image upload tool.This is a move away from the upload service Imgur, which was a de facto service. Users can upload images to Reddit using Imgur. Reddit's in-house video upload service for desktop and mobile was launched in 2017. Previously, users were required to use a third-party video upload service, but Reddit admitted it would be time consuming for users.
Reddit released the "Spoiler tag" feature in 2017/1. This feature warns users of potential spoilers for posts and pixelates the preview image. Reddit announced a change to its public front page in 2017 called r/popular.This change will create a front page with no potentially adult-oriented content for unregistered users.
In late 2017, Reddit declared it wanted to be a mobile-first site and made some changes to its apps for iOS and Android. The new features included user-to-user chat, theater mode for viewing visual content, and mobile tools for site moderators. "Mod mode" allows moderators to manage content on mobile devices and their subreddit.
Reddit launched its redesigned website in 2018, the first major visual update in 10 years. The development of the new site took more than 1 year. This was the result of an initiative by Huffman when he returned to Reddit, saying the site's outdated look deterred new users. The new site has a burger menu, a variety of views and a new font to help users navigate the site and click on Reddit posts and external links The goal was to make Reddit not only improve its appearance, but also make it easier to accommodate a new generation of Reddit users. In addition, Reddit's growth was putting a strain on the site's back-end.Huffman and Reddit's vice president of engineering Nick Caldwell told the Wall Street Journal's COI Journal that Reddit needs to leverage artificial intelligence and other modern digital tools. Registered users can opt out of the redesign and use the "old Reddit" to continue using the previous design. Unregistered users can access it in the following ways:old.reddit.com ...
Logo
Reddit's logo consists of a time-traveling alien named Snoo and the company name stylized as "reddit". The alien has an oval head, pom-pom ears, and an antenna. Its colors are black, white, and orange-red. The mascot was created in 2005 while company co-founder Alexis Ohanian was an undergraduate at the University of Virginia. Ohanian drew a doodle of the creature while he was bored during a marketing class. Originally, Ohanian sought to name the mascot S'new, a play on "What's new?", to tie the mascot into Reddit's premise as the "front page of the Internet". Eventually, the name Snoo was chosen. In 2011, Ohanian outlined the logo's evolution with a graphic that showcased several early versions, including various spellings of the website name, such as "Reditt".
Snoo is genderless, so the logo is moldable. Over the years, the Reddit logo has frequently changed for holidays and other special events. Many subreddits have a customized Snoo logo to represent the subreddit. Redditors can also submit their own logos, which sometimes appear on the site's front page, or create their own customized versions of Snoo for their communities (or "subreddits"). When Reddit revamped its website in April 2018, the company imposed several restrictions on how Snoo can be designed: Snoo's head "should always appear blank or neutral", Snoo's eyes are orange-red, and Snoo cannot have fingers. Snoo's purpose is to discover and explore humanity.
Corporate affairs
Reddit is a private company based in San Francisco. It has an office in the Mid-Market neighborhood. Reddit doubled its headcount in 2017; as of 2018, it employed approximately 350 people. In 2017, the company was valued at $1.8 billion during a $200 million round of new venture funding. The company was previously owned by Condé Nast, but was spun off as an independent company. As of April 2018, Advance Publications, Condé Nast's parent company, retained a majority stake in Reddit.
Reddit's key management personnel includes co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman, Chief Technology Officer Chris Slowe, who was the company's original lead engineer, and Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong, a former president of digital and chief operating officer at Time Inc.
Reddit does not disclose its revenue figures. The company generates revenue in part through advertising and premium memberships that remove ads from the site.
As part of its company culture, Reddit operates on a no-negotiation policy for employee salaries. The company offers new mothers, fathers, and adoptive parents up to 16 weeks of parental leave.
As of August 2021, Reddit is valued at more than $10 billion following a $410 million funding round. The company is looking to hire investment bankers and lawyers to assist in making an initial public offering. However, CEO Steve Huffman says the company has not decided on the timing for when to go public. In December 2021, Reddit announced they had filed a draft registration statement with the SEC regarding their prospective IPO.
Advertising
In February 2013, Betabeat published a post that recognized the influx of multinational corporations like Costco, Taco Bell, Subaru, and McDonald's posting branded content on Reddit that was made to appear as if it was original content from legitimate Reddit users. PAN Communications wrote that marketers want to "infiltrate the reddit community on behalf of their brand," but emphasized that "self-promotion is frowned upon" and Reddit's former director of communications noted that the site is "100 percent organic." She recommended that advertisers design promotions that "spark conversations and feedback." She recommended that businesses use AMAs to get attention for public figures but cautioned "It is important to approach AMAs carefully and be aware that this may not be a fit for every project or client." Nissan ran a successful branded content promotion offering users free gifts to publicize a new car, though the company was later ridiculed for suspected astroturfing when the CEO only answered puff piece questions on the site. Taylor described these situations as "high risk" noting: "We try hard to educate people that they have to treat questions that may seem irreverent or out of left field the same as they would questions about the specific project they are promoting."
Reddit's users tend to be more privacy-conscious than on other websites, often using tools like AdBlock and proxies, and they dislike "feeling manipulated by brands" but respond well to "content that begs for intelligent viewers and participants." Lauren Orsini writes in ReadWrite that "Reddit's huge community is the perfect hype machine for promoting a new movie, a product release, or a lagging political campaign" but there is a "very specific set of etiquette. Redditors don't want to advertise for you, they want to talk to you." Journalists have used the site as a basis for stories, though they are advised by the site's policies to respect that "reddit's communities belong to their members" and to seek proper attribution for people's contributions.
Reddit announced that they would begin using VigLink to redirect affiliate links in June 2016.
Since 2017, Reddit has partnered with companies to host sponsored AMAs and other interactive events, increased advertising offerings, and introduced efforts to work with content publishers.
In 2018, Reddit hired Jen Wong as COO, responsible for the company's business strategy and growth, and introduced native mobile ads. Reddit opened a Chicago office to be closer to major companies and advertising agencies located in and around Chicago. In 2019, Reddit hired former Twitter ad director Shariq Rizvi as its vice president of ad products and engineering.
Community and culture
The website is known for its open nature and diverse user community that generate its content. Its demographics allows for wide-ranging subject areas, as well as the ability for smaller subreddits to serve more niche purposes. The possibilities that subreddits provide create new opportunities for raising attention and fostering discussion across various areas. In gaining popularity in terms of unique users per day, Reddit has been a platform to raise publicity for a number of causes. Additionally, the user base of Reddit has given birth to other websites, including image sharing community and image host Imgur, which started in 2009 as a gift to Reddit's community. In its first five months, it jumped from a thousand hits per day to a million total page views.
Statistics from Google Ad Planner suggest that 74% of Reddit users are male. In 2016, the Pew Research Center published research showing that 4% of U.S. adults use Reddit, of which 67% are men. 78% of users get news from Reddit. Users tend to be significantly younger than average with less than 1% of users being 65 or over. Politically, Reddit's community is predominantly left-leaning, with less than 19% of its users leaning to the right.
Reddit is known in part for its passionate user base, which has been described as "offbeat, quirky, and anti-establishment". Similar to the "Slashdot effect", the Reddit effect occurs when a smaller website crashes due to a high influx of traffic after being linked to on Reddit; this is also called the Reddit "hug of death".
Philanthropy
Users have used Reddit as a platform for their charitable and philanthropic efforts. Redditors raised more than $100,000 for charity in support of comedians Jon Stewart's and Stephen Colbert's Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear; more than $180,000 for Haiti earthquake relief efforts; and delivered food pantries' Amazon wish lists. In 2010, Christians, Muslims, and atheists held a friendly fundraising competition, where the groups raised more than $50,000. A similar donation drive in 2011 saw the atheism subreddit raise over $200,000 for charity. In February 2014, Reddit announced it would donate 10% of its annual ad revenue to non-profits voted upon by its users. As a result of the campaign, Reddit donated $82,765 each to Electronic Frontier Foundation, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Doctors Without Borders, Erowid Center, Wikimedia Foundation, Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, NPR, Free Software Foundation, Freedom From Religion Foundation, and Tor Project.
Activism
Reddit has been used for a wide variety of political engagements, including the presidential elections of Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. It is also used for self-organized socio-political activities, such as protests, communication with politicians and active communities. Reddit has become a popular place for global political debate.
March for Science
The March for Science stems from a Reddit debate over the removal of all references to climate change from the White House website, with users commenting that "A march of scientists is needed in Washington." In 2017/4/22, more than 100 million scientists and supporters participated in more than 66 events in 600 countries around the world.
Internet privacy, Neutrality and anonymity
Reddit users have been engaged in the defense of Internet privacy, net neutrality, and Internet anonymity.
Reddit created an Internet blackout day and protected IP act, joined by Wikipedia and other sites in 2012 in an online piracy protest that stopped 1/18, Reddit joined a 12-hour site-wide blackout to coincide with a Congressional committee hearing on measures. In the meantime, Reddit displayed a message about the impact of the law on reddit, in addition to resources on the proposed law. In 2012/5, Reddit joined the Internet Defense League, a group formed to organize future protests.
The site and its users protested to the Federal Communications Commission, which is preparing to repeal net neutrality rules. In 2017, users fully supported the post "Battle for The Net", filling the entire front page. On another day, the front page was overtaken by an article introducing campaign donations received by members of Congress from the telecommunications industry. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman is also advocating net neutrality rules.
