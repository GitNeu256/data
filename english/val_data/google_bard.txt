Bard is a conversational generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Google, initially based on the LaMDA family of large-scale language models (LLMs) and later on PaLM, developed as a direct response to the rise of OpenAI's ChatGPT, released in March 2023 for a limited, lukewarm response, then expanded to other countries in May.
LaMDA was developed and announced in 2021 but was not released to the public; OpenAI announced ChatGPT in November 2022, and its popularity caught Google executives off guard and sent them into a panic. After mobilizing its workforce, the company scrambled to launch Bard in February 2023, and the chatbot took center stage at the 2023 Google I/O keynote in May.
Background
In November 2022, OpenAI announced ChatGPT, a chatbot based on the GPT-3 family of Large Language Models (LLMs).ChatGPT attracted worldwide attention after its release and became a viral internet sensation.ChatGPT could threaten Google search, Google executives issued a "Code Red" warning and reassigned several teams supporting the company's artificial intelligence (AI) efforts. It was widely reported that Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and parent company Alphabet, issued the warning, which Pichai later denied to The New York Times. In a rare and unprecedented move, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who stepped down as co-CEOs of Alphabet in 2019, were called into an emergency meeting with company executives to discuss Google's response to ChatGPT.
In early 2021, the company had announced LaMDA, a prototype of LLM, but had not released it to the public. At the all-hands meeting, Pichai and Google's AI chief Jeff Dean, who was asked by an employee whether LaMDA was a missed opportunity for Google to compete with ChatGPT, said that the company has similar capabilities to ChatGPT, but that moving too quickly in that area would mean that Google significantly larger than OpenAI, he said, and would be a major "reputational risk. "In January 2023, Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google's sister company DeepMind, hinted at plans for a ChatGPT competitor, and Google employees were instructed to accelerate progress on the ChatGPT competitor directed to intensively test "Apprentice Bird" and other chatbots. During Google's quarterly earnings call with investors in February, Pichai assured investors that the company had plans to expand LaMDA's availability and applications.
History
Announcement.
On February 6, 2023, Google announced Bard, a LaMDA-powered conversational generative artificial intelligence chatbot Bard will first be rolled out to a select group of 10,000 "trusted testers" and then widely released later this month Bard is overseen by product lead Jack Krawczyk, who described the product as a "collaborative AI service" rather than a search engine, and Pichai detailed how Bard will be integrated into Google Search. Reuters calculated that adding ChatGPT-like functionality to Google Search would cost Google an additional $6 billion by 2024, while research and consulting firm SemiAnalysis calculated that it would cost Google $3 billion. The technology was developed under the codename "Atlas," and the name "Bard," a reference to the Celtic word for storyteller, was chosen to "reflect the creative nature of the underlying algorithm."
Several media and financial analysts have said that Google "rushed" the announcement of Bard in order to preempt an event scheduled for February 7, when rival Microsoft will announce its partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its Bing search engine in the form of Bing Chat and described it as a way to "catch up" with Microsoft. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told The Verge: "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told The Verge that "Tom Warren of The Verge and Davey Alba of Bloomberg News noted that after the six-year "truce" expires in 2021, this will mark the beginning of a new clash between the two big tech companies over the "future of search" and The Guardian's Chris Stokel-Walker, Sarah Morrison of Recode, and analyst Dan Ives of investment firm Wedbush Securities said this is an AI arms race between the two companies.
After the "underwhelming" livestream introducing Bard in Paris on February 8, Google's stock price fell 8%, equivalent to a $100 billion loss in market value, and the livestream's YouTube video was taken private. Many viewers also pointed out Bard's mistake of giving inaccurate information about the James Webb Space Telescope in response to inquiries during the demonstration. Google employees criticized Pichai's announcement of Bard as "rushed" and "botched" on Memgen, an internal forum, and Futurism's Maggie Harrison called the development "chaotic." Pichai defended his actions, saying Google has been "deeply committed to AI for a long time," and dismissed the notion that Bird's announcement was a knee-jerk reaction. Alphabet Chairman John Hennessey acknowledged that Bird is not fully commercializable, but expressed excitement about the technology's potential.
A week after the James Webb debacle, Pichai asked employees to devote two to four hours to testing Bird's dog food, and Google executive Prabhakar Raghavan encouraged employees to correct Bird's errors. 80,000 employees responded to Pichai's call. In the weeks that followed, Google employees thoroughly criticized Bird in internal messages and called on company leaders not to launch the service, citing various safety and ethical concerns. Trying to prioritize catching up with competitors, Google executives decided to launch the service anyway, overruling a curt risk assessment report conducted by the AI ethics team. After Pichai abruptly laid off 12,000 employees later that month, citing revenue growth, the remaining employees shared memes and snippets of humorous exchanges with Bird, asking for "input" on the layoffs. In mid-March, Google employees began testing a more sophisticated version of Bard with larger parameters, called "Big Bard. "In 2023, Bard will introduce new integrations with Gmail, Docs, and Drive, and users will have the option of having Bard retrieve information from these platforms increased utility by allowing users to choose to retrieve information directly from
Launch
Google launched Bard early access on March 21, 2023 on a limited basis, with users in the U.S. and U.K. able to join a waiting list. Unlike Microsoft's Bing Chat approach, Bard was launched as an independent web application featuring a text box and a disclaimer that the chatbot "may display inaccurate or offensive information that does not represent Google's views." Three answers were then provided for each question, and users were prompted to submit feedback on the usefulness of each answer. Google Vice Presidents Sissy Hsiao and Eli Collins said that Bird is a complement to Google Search and that no decision has been made on how to monetize this service. Those granted early access were subscribers to Google's "Pixel Superfans" loyalty program, users of Pixel and Nest devices, and Google One subscribers.
Bard is trained by third-party contractors hired by Google, including employees of Appen and Accenture, which Business Insider and Bloomberg News reported were placed under extreme pressure, overwork, and low pay Bard is also trained by third-party contractors hired by Google, including employees of Appen and Accenture, which Business Insider and Bloomberg News reported were placed under extreme pressure, overwork, and low pay Bard also has a publicly available Shortly after Bard's initial launch, Google reorganized the team behind its virtual assistant, Google Assistant, to focus instead on Bard. Google researcher Jacob Devlin resigned from the company, claiming that Bard was secretly using ChatGPT data, but Google denied the allegations. Meanwhile, the company's senior software engineer released an internal memo warning that Google is falling behind independent researchers in the AI "arms race," not OpenAI but the open source community. On March 31, Pichai revealed that the company intends to "upgrade" Bard to be based not on LaMDA but on PaLM, Google's newer and more powerful LLM. The same day, Krafcik announced that Google had added "math and logic capabilities" to Bard, which gained coding assistance in April and supported more than 20 programming languages at launch. Microsoft also began placing ads in the address bar of developer builds of its Edge browser, encouraging users to try Bing every time they access Bard's web app. Google is in the process of integrating Bard into its ChromeOS OS and Pixel devices.
Updates
Bard took center stage during the annual Google I/O keynote in May 2023, with Pichai and Hsiao announcing a series of updates to Bard, including the adoption of PaLM 2, integration with other Google products and third-party services, expansion to 180 countries, support for additional languages, and new features. In a stark contrast to previous years, the Google Assistant was barely mentioned during the event. The expanded rollout did not include any nations in the European Union (EU), possibly reflecting concerns about compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation. Those with Google Workspace accounts also gained access to the service. Google attempted to launch Bard in the EU in June, but was blocked by the Irish Data Protection Commission, who requested for a "data protection impact assessment" from the company. In July, Google launched Bard in the EU and Brazil, added support for dozens of new languages, and introduced multiple new personalization and productivity features. An invite-only chatroom ("server") on Discord was created in July, consisting of users who heavily use Bard. Over the next few months, the chatroom was flooded with comments questioning the usefulness of Bard.
Reflecting on Bard's launch in an interview with Wired in September, Pichai acknowledged that Google had been "cautious" to release LaMDA because of "the responsibility that comes with getting it right", complimenting OpenAI for ChatGPT's launch and firing back at Nadella's comment about making Google dance. Google released a major update to the chatbot later that month, integrating it into many of its products through "extensions", adding a button to fact-check AI-generated responses through Google Search, and allowing users to share conversation threads. Google also introduced the "Google-Extended" web crawler as part of its search engine's robots.txt indexing file to allow web publishers to opt-out of allowing Bard to scan them for training. Online users later discovered that Google Search was indexing Bard conversation threads on which users had enabled sharing. Google stated that this was an error and quickly moved to rectify the leaks.
In October, during the company's annual Made by Google event in which it announced the Pixel 8 series and the Pixel Watch 2, Hsiao unveiled "Assistant with Bard", an upgraded version of the Google Assistant which was deeply integrated with Bard, following in the footsteps of Amazon's approach with Alexa.
Reception
Bard received mixed reviews upon its initial release. James Vincent of The Verge found Bard faster than ChatGPT and Bing Chat, but noted that the lack of Bing-esque footnotes was "both a blessing and a curse", encouraging Google to be bolder when experimenting with AI. His colleague David Pierce was unimpressed by its uninteresting and sometimes inaccurate responses, adding that despite Google's insistence that Bard was not a search engine, its user interface resembled that of one, which could cause problems for Google. Cade Metz of The New York Times described Bard as "more cautious" than ChatGPT, while Shirin Ghaffary of Vox called it "dry and uncontroversial" due to the reserved nature of its responses.
The Washington Post columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler found Bard a mixed bag, noting that it acted cautiously but could show Internet-influenced bias. Writing for ZDNet, Sabrina Ortiz believed ChatGPT and Bing Chat were "more capable overall" in comparison to Bard, while Wired journalist Lauren Goode found her conversation with Bard "the most bizarre" of the three. After the introduction of extensions, The New York Times' Kevin Roose found the update underwhelming and "a bit of a mess", while Business Insider's Lakshmi Varanasi found that Bard often leaned more into flattery than facts.
In a 60 Minutes conversation with Hsiao, Google senior vice president James Manyika, and Pichai, CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley found Bard "unsettling". Associate professor Ethan Mollick of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania was underwhelmed by Bard's artistic ineptitude. The Times later conducted a test with ChatGPT and Bard regarding their ability to handle tasks expected of human assistants, and concluded that ChatGPT's performance was vastly superior to that of Bard. NewsGuard, a tool which rates the credibility of news articles, found that Bard was more skilled at debunking known conspiracy theories than ChatGPT.
