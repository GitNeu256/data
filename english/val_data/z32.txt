The Z32 was a German destroyer of the 1936A class, built in 1941 and served in the Kriegsmarine during World War II. It was the tenth in the class, and it was the first in the Mob sub-class to be equipped with the new 150 mm SK C/34 L/55 guns.
The Z32 was 127 meters long, had a beam of 12 meters, and a displacement of 3,600 tons. It was powered by two steam turbines, which gave it a top speed of 38.5 knots. The ship was armed with four 150-mm guns in four single turrets, eight 37-mm guns, nine 20-mm guns, and eight 533-mm torpedo tubes.
The Z32 was commissioned into the Kriegsmarine on August 15, 1942. It was initially assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, and it served in Norway and the North Atlantic. The ship saw action in several engagements, including the Battle of Barents Sea on December 31, 1942.
In 1944, the Z32 was transferred to the Mediterranean, where it operated against Allied shipping. The ship was damaged by a British air attack on January 21, 1945, but it was repaired and returned to service.
The Z32 was surrendered to the Allies at the end of World War II. It was transferred to the French Navy, and it was renamed Maillé Brézé. The ship served in the French Navy until 1962, when it was scrapped.
