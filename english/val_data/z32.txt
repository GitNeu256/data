Z32 was a German Type 1936A (mob) destroyer completed in 1942 and was part of the German Navy's 8th Destroyer Squadron during World War II. She fought alongside the German 8th Destroyer Group and the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla against HMS Glasgow and HMS Enterprise during the Battle of the Bay of Biscay, and was sunk on 9 June 1944 at the Battle of Ushant.
Construction and design
On June 28, 1939, Nazi Germany ordered nine Type 1938B destroyers (Z31-Z39); three more were ordered in July. designed for long range. However, when World War II broke out, the order for the Type 1938B destroyers was cancelled and Germany reverted to the Type 1936A (Mob) class, a slight modification of the previous Type 1936A. 9 September 1939, four destroyers (Z31 to Z34) were built at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen, They were reordered from the Decimag Consortium. Three more (Z37-Z39) were ordered from the Germaniawerft shipyard; Z32 was broken ground on 1 November 1940 (yard number 1002), launched on 15 August 1941, and commissioned on 15 September 1942.
The Z32 was 127 meters (416 feet 8 inches) long, with a draft line length of 121.9 meters (399 feet 11 inches), a beam of 12 meters (39 feet 4 inches), and a draft of 3.92 to 4.62 meters (depending on displacement). Displacement is 2,645 tons (2,603 tons) standard and 3,655 tons (3,597 tons) fully loaded. High-pressure superheated steam (70 atmospheres (1,029 psi, 7,093 kPa), 450Â°C) from six Wagner boilers is fed to two Wagner geared steam turbines. Rated output was 70,000 shaft horsepower (52,000 kW) and speed was 38.5 knots (71.3 km/h, 44.3 mph). Her range was 2,239 nautical miles (4,147 km, 2,577 miles) at 19 knots (35 km/h, 22 mph). The officer and crew complement was 321.
The Z32's main armament was five 15cm TbtsK C/36 ship guns, with one continuous turret forward and three single turrets aft. Due to the late development of twin turrets, the Z32 was the first ship in its class to be fully equipped with this armament. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of two 3.7cm SK C/30 anti-aircraft guns (later replaced by automatic Flak M42 guns) and nine 2cm guns (one quadruple and five single guns); a second quadruple 2cm gun was installed forward of the bridge in 1943, replacing one single gun. Equipped with a capacity of up to 60 mines.
SERVICE
After commissioning, Z32 was assigned to the 8th Destroyer Squadron and headed for the French Atlantic coast via the English Channel from March 5 to 8, 1943, in Operation Karin. Despite being hit by British gunfire off Dover, the convoy arrived at Bordeaux unscathed on March 8, and on March 28, Z32 was one of four destroyers to provide distant escort for the Italian blockade transport Himalaya. They sailed from Bordeaux to the Far East with an escort of nine torpedo boats, but were spotted by British aerial reconnaissance and the unit turned back; on March 30, Z32, along with destroyers Z23, Z24, and Z37, sailed to intercept the incoming blockade runner Pietro Orseolo. A heavy British air attack was repulsed, but Pietro Orseolo was damaged by a torpedo from the U.S. submarine Shad before reaching safety at the mouth of the Gironde River on April 2. On April 9, Z32 covered the Himalaya in an attempted breakout, but was again frustrated by a British air attack. Z32's other operations included covering German U-boats leaving and returning to their French bases.
On December 24, 1943, the 8th Destroyer Group, consisting of six destroyers, including Z32, and the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, consisting of six torpedo boats, sailed to intercept the blockade boat Osorno and encountered her on December 25. Despite heavy air attack, they succeeded in escorting Osorno to Gironde, but Osorno hit a submerged wreck and had to be beached to save her cargo; on December 26, the 8th Destroyer Squadron (again including Z32) and the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, another blockade transport, Alsterufer again set sail to pick up the ship. Unbeknownst to the Germans, Alsterhofer was attacked on December 27 by B-24 Liberator bombers of Royal Air Force Squadron 311 (Czechoslovakia), caught fire, and was abandoned by her crew; around noon on December 28, the British cruisers Glasgow, which was on patrol in the Bay of Biscay, and Enterprise encountered German destroyers and torpedo boats attempting to intercept the blockade runners, causing the Battle of the Bay of Biscay. The Germans attempted a pincer operation, but were thwarted by heavy seas. Destroyer Z27 and torpedo boats T25 and T27 were sunk; Z33 fired six torpedoes at the British cruiser, all missing.
On January 30, 1944, Z32 collided with Z37 during maneuvers with Z23 and Z37 in the southern Bay of Biscay; Z32 sustained damage to her degaussing system and a fire in her stern caused by loose anti-aircraft ammunition. Meanwhile, one of Z37's torpedoes exploded, causing a fire and flooding; Z32 remained under repair until 2 May; Z37 was deemed beyond economical repair and disarmed; Z32 ran aground on 5 May and was again damaged and underwent repairs for another month; Z37's torpedo system was damaged by the explosion of one of Z32's torpedoes, causing a fire and flooding; and Z37 was disarmed on 5 May.
On June 6, 1944, after the Normandy landings, Destroyer Squadron 8, consisting of destroyers Z32, Z24, ZH1, and torpedo boat T24, sailed for Brest for operations against the invasion fleet; Z32 was damaged by British rockets; on June 8 and 9, the four ships left Brest for Cherbourg. ZH1 was torpedoed and sunk by the British destroyer Ashanti, and Z32 was pursued by the Canadian destroyers Haida and Huron. The other two German ships escaped back to Cherbourg, but the British destroyer Tartar was damaged.
