There is no doubt that the antique market is alive and thriving with various highly rated shows on television’s History Channel. You can see some of the same quality antiques at the Heritage Antique Market at Cloverdale Mall. The Heritage Antique Market is held once a month at Cloverdale Mall which is located at 250 The East Mall at Dundas and 427. Dealers come in from local towns just outside of Toronto but also across Ontario as well as Quebec. You’ll find everything dating back as far as the 19th century. You’ll find great art pieces, pottery, collectibles, flatware and more. Looking at some vintage high quality clothing at reasonable prices? Come on down. The organizers have several shows across the GTA but the Cloverdale Mall show is the only one in the West end. Our personal favourite items are the various furniture pieces on display. Stopping in at a friend’s we had asked where she bought her fabulous kitchen table and she mentioned she found it through a dealer at the Heritage Antique Market. Shopping for antiques can be a time-consuming process with having to travel to places like Niagara on the Lake and other little towns outside the GTA. Having an antique show come to our neck of the woods once a month makes things much, much easier.
