Live2D is animation software that does not require frame-by-frame animation or 3D models, but can generate real-time 2D animation centered on animation-like characters by layering successive parts based on an illustration. This allows the user to move characters in 2.5D motion while maintaining the original illustration.
Live2D characters are composed of layered parts. By moving the parts individually, it is possible to express the character's overall animation and facial expressions, such as tilting the head. Parts can be as simple as the face, hair, and body, or as detailed as eyebrows, eyelashes, or a section of hair that needs to be moved. The number of layers depends on how you want to represent the movement of your Live2D character. Live2D can be used in conjunction with real-time motion capture to track movement and lip-sync for real-time applications such as Vtubers. Live2D can be used in conjunction with real-time motion capture to track movement and lip-sync for real-time applications such as Vtubers. The downside to this technology is that there is currently no official setting for 360Â° rotation. It is also difficult to rotate complex images and characters at large angles.
Live2D is used in a variety of media, including video games, visual novels, and virtual YouTuber channels, such as FaceRig, VTube Studio, Nekopara, Azur Lane, virtual YouTubers (Hololive, Nijisanji, VShojo) are typical examples of Live2D.
History
Live2D was first introduced in 2008 out of necessity for interactive media. Since then, the technology has also changed the way games enhance the user experience through lively characters and expressions.
In 2009, Cubism (now Live2D) released its first Live2D application, Live2D vector. This application transforms vector graphics to achieve three-dimensional head-swinging and motion effects on flat character images. Although such characters are capable of limited movement, they perform much better than still images or slideshows. You can also customize your own moving character by adjusting parameters in the software and collecting materials such as images of various angles of the character. Of course, vector graphics still have many limitations. Although they occupy fewer capacity resources, they consume a lot of CPU to render complex images. Another drawback is the inability to represent specific painting styles, such as oil or gouache paintings.
The first application that applied Live2D technology was the alarm application "HibikiDokei" released by sandwichproject in 2010. In this alarm app, a girl character named "Hibiki" speaks and moves.
In 2011, "Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai Portable" for PSP released by Namco Bandai Games Inc. adopted Live2D, and the O.I.U system derived from Live2D technology was applied to a game for the first time. The characters moved expressively on the screen, surprising players with their seamless, anime-like movements, and triggered the popularity of Live2D.
Software
Live2D Inc.
Tetsuya Nakashiro, a software developer who had independently developed Live2D, established Cybernoise in 2006 with the support of the "Exploratory IT Human Resources Discovery and Development Project" of the Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan (IPA). Cybernoise was a failure due to its novelty and low penetration rate.
In 2011, Live2D was adopted in "Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai Portable" for PSP, attracting much attention. Subsequently, it also attracted attention as a library for Android and iOS. Following this success, in 2014, Cybernoise changed its company name to "Live2D Inc." to unify it with the product name. Since then, Live2D's sales have grown significantly: in 2021, 70% of Live2D Cubism Pro users will be Vtubers, followed by games/apps (videos) and animation/video productions.

Meaning
Live2D can protect your privacy when using a virtual YouTuber (VTuber). Privacy is very important, especially in this age of information technology. Protecting privacy (in its many forms) is very important in today's Internet age. Virtual Youtuber is the term given by Youtuber Bag, who uses real-time animation in place of himself. This refers to showing oneself in the form of content for fear that one's privacy will be spread. The creation of a virtual YouTuber begins with rigging the character using Live2D, installing facial motion capture using OpenCV and Dib SDK, combining it with the Unity engine as a blueprint, and rigging character with Aiming at facial motion capture, by acquiring a rigged character in Live2D virtually, creating a character according to the content creator's wishes, and creating a virtual YouTuber using facial motion capture technology in the Unity engine. By doing so, the character can follow the content creator's facial movements and produce videos using YouTube's virtual technology. The built application can be published in the form of videos and streaming on the YouTube platform using OBS Studio.
