Mobile DNA consists of blocks of DNA that can be moved or inserted into new locations in the genome without requiring DNA sequence similarity and without requiring a process of homologous recombination to enable movement.
This process of migration and insertion is often referred to as translocation, and mobile DNA is often referred to as a transposon. Some mobile DNA ("DNA elements"), such as retrotransposons, move by a different mechanism than strictly defined transposons, but the overall result is the same: moving a block of DNA to a new position within the chromosome.
The general topic of mobile DNA also includes other genetic entities that can move between organisms, such as plasmids and viruses. Plasmids and bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) are often involved in the transfer of mobile DNA between different microorganisms, and plasmids often have a variety of transposons.
Transposition
Transposition is the process by which a piece of DNA moves through the genome, often making copies of itself simultaneously. Not all DNA does this, only those parts that are called transposons, transposable elements, or jumping genes.
Transposons have been called junk DNA because they have no useful function, and selfish DNA because they exploit the genetic mechanisms of the cell. A more modern view is that these terms do not accurately convey the full range of transposon behavior, which ranges from parasitism to mutualism.
Transposon activity has allowed pathogenic bacteria to acquire resistance to many antibiotics and to take the awkward advantage of transmitting this multidrug resistance in a highly infectious manner.
It is becoming increasingly clear that transposons are involved in the evolution of novel functions and complex regulatory circuits in multicellular organisms.
Mechanisms of Transposons
Transposons require the enzyme transposase, which usually encodes at least one gene, and transposons usually encode themselves. The end of the transposon consists of a terminal DNA repeat to which the transposase binds. The transposase also binds to its target site on the genome and cleaves it, leaving a "sticky end," or an overhang of single-stranded DNA similar to that created by restriction endonucleases. Depending on the type of transposon, the DNA is either copied or cut away and inserted into the target site by the action of an enzyme called DNA ligase. Some transposons encode their own copying mechanism, but most use the cell's own DNA copying mechanism.
See Types of Transposons for the mechanism.
There are three types of transposons, classified according to their mechanisms:
Class I: retrotransposons
Retrotransposons
Retrotransposons (and sometimes retroposons) function by copying themselves and pasting the copies to multiple locations in the genome. First, the retrotransposon copies itself into RNA (transcription), but instead of being translated, the RNA is picked up by reverse transcriptase (often encoded by the transposon itself), which copies the RNA into DNA and inserts it into the genome. This process is called retropositioning, and the new gene is called a retrogenome. Retrotransposons usually have very long terminal repeat sequences of 1000 base pairs or more, making them easy to discover and study.
Retrotransposons behave very similarly to retroviruses such as HIV, providing clues to their evolutionary origins (see Transposon Evolution).
Retrotransposons can cause gene duplication when they move to a new location, a process called 3' transduction. Such gene duplication is an important mechanism for creating new genes and genomic novelty. The introduction of flanking DNA sequences via retrotransposons, resulting in the duplication of entire genes and the creation of previously undescribed gene families, has recently received attention as an important mechanism by which mobile DNA can influence the host genome during evolution.
Class II Transposons
Class II transposons move by cut-and-paste rather than copy-and-paste using transposase enzymes. Different types of transposases work in different ways: some can bind to any part of the DNA molecule, while others bind to specific sequences. The transposase then cleaves the target site to create a sticky end, cuts out the transposon, ligases it to the target site, and fills the sticky end with its base pair.
A transposon may lose its ability to synthesize transposase by mutation, but it continues to jump through the genome because other transposons are still producing transposase. Some transposons become transposons simply because the mutation creates a sequence that signals to the transposase.
The P Element
The P element is a class II transposon, first discovered in Drosophila in the 1950s. the P element has a very high diffusion capacity and causes so many mutations in the germline that it renders the fly sterile. However, Drosophila has evolved a mechanism to suppress transposases and, except in a few isolated laboratory populations, is unaffected by the P element. Cirrhosporid nematodes have evolved RNA interference systems to deal with similar problems with transposons.
Mulet and PacMulet
Maize mutator (Mu) transposons are known to capture portions of host genes and rapidly amplify them by subsequent replication. The related mu-like elements (MULEs), a family of transposons widely distributed in plants and fungi, are thought to be the result of this process.
Similar examples of gene capture have been observed in other class II elements such as the CACTA element, hAT element, and helitrons, suggesting that this gene capture process may be a feature of many transposons.
MULEs have terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), and MULE inverted repeats (TIRs) often sandwich host gene capture fragments. Such TIRs of MULEs with captured genes are called Pack-MULEs.
There are more than 3,000 Pack-MULEs in rice, including fragments derived from more than 1,000 cellular genes; Pack-MULEs often contain fragments of multiple genes fused together to form a new gene. Some of the gene fragments incorporated into rice Pack-MULEs are functional new genes.
Class III: Miniature Inverted Repeat Transposable Elements
MITEs are sequences of about 400 base pairs and 15 base pairs of inverted repeats that change very little MITEs have been found in thousands of animal and plant genomes (more than 100,000 were found in the rice genome) MITEs are too small to encode proteins; they are not a major component of the genome, but they are a major component of the genome.
Effects of Transposons on Genomes
Transposons can cause mutations. Transposons cause mutations either by inserting into the coding region of a gene, losing part of the gene in the process, or by inserting into a region upstream of the coding region of a gene that is important in determining gene expression, such as where transcription factors bind to DNA. Insertions into genes may also cause alternative splicing that increases the diversity of proteins produced from a single gene.
Both transposons and retrotransposons can cause DNA replication. This is an important first step in the evolution of new information, a process by which the sequence of replicated genes changes more rapidly.
Retrotransposons have been shown to be active in primate genomes, including human genomes, where they promote many gene evolutionary events by creating new genes and generating genomic novelty.
For example, SVAs are the youngest primate retrotransposon family and can capture 3'-flanking sequences during retrotransposition (3'-transduction to effectively replicate genes).
Recent studies of the human genome have shown that approximately 53,000 base pairs of genomic sequences are replicated by 143 different SVA-mediated flanking gene capture (3'-transduction) events.
One group of SVA elements duplicated the entire AMAC gene of the human genome three times, which occurred before the divergence of humans and African apes. In addition to the original AMAC gene, the three transfected (duplicated) AMAC copies contain protein coding sequences that are intact in the human genome, and at least two are actively transcribed in different human tissues.
Transposons are involved in the creation of new "chimeric" (hybrid) proteins through gene fusion and in the generation of complex new gene regulatory network circuits in natural evolution.
An important example of this evolutionary role is the discovery in human evolution of a member of the Mariner family of transposons called Hsmar1. Hsmar1 (Homo sapiens mariner) exists as approximately 1500 copies of mobile DNA in the human genome.
SETMAR is a new primate chimeric gene resulting from the fusion of the SET histone methyltransferase gene with the Hsmar1 mobile DNA transposase gene. The transposase gene was adopted as part of the ape SETMAR 40-58 million years ago after the Hsmar1 transposon was inserted downstream of the existing SET gene.
Retrotransposon-mediated translocation of genes to new chromosomal positions (retropositioning) has generated a substantial number of new functional genes (retrogenes) in mammalian and invertebrate genomes. The explosion of retropositioning in primates has resulted in the emergence of many new human genes during the past ~63 million years of primate evolution.
Transposons also increase genome size because they leave multiple copies of themselves in the genome. For example, the maize genome has doubled in size over the past 3 to 6 million years, largely due to the mass formation of retrogenes.
Transposons can contribute to diseases such as cancer and hemophilia A (when the blood coagulation factor VIII gene is destroyed) and B (blood coagulation factor IX).
Evolution of Transposons
Transposon evolution is an area that is currently the subject of much research, and it is not yet possible to say exactly how transposons came into being. We do know, however, that there are many similar transposons in all major groups of organisms on Earth. There are three plausible hypotheses as to how this came about:
* Transposons were present in the last universal common ancestor.
* Transposons existed in the last universal common ancestor.
* Transposons could be spread by viruses or other mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer.
The hypothesis that transposons spread in viruses is supported by evidence in bacteria. In many bacteria, transposons contain genes for antibiotic resistance, and when cut from the bacterial circular DNA, the plasmids generated can be transferred to other bacterial cells and spread resistance to other species by horizontal gene transfer.
In terms of genetic selection, there is a clear selective advantage from the point of view of a piece of DNA that simply copies itself and lets the rest of the genome do all the work. At first glance, transposons are bad for the whole gene, causing mutations and gene silencing. However, it is also possible that transposons are selectively advantageous to the genome as a whole. The bulking up of the genome by transposons and other noncoding DNA could facilitate gene regulation. Some retrotransposons and retroviruses have DNA-like sequences with exons, promoters, and enhancer regions, which may also play a role in gene regulation or provide a good evolutionary substrate. Transposon activity is greater when the organism is under stress, and this may lead to higher mutation rates when the organism is in an unadapted environment. There is also evidence that the larger the genome, the more stable it is and the better it can withstand temperature stress.
Discovery of Transposons
Transposons were first discovered in maize in 1948 by Barbara McClintock. McClintock noticed unusual genetic behavior in maize kernels, such as variation and genetic instability, and attributed it to DNA insertions, deletions, translocations, and somatic mutations. While these observations were not new to science, McClintock's interpretation was "before its time." Her discovery of mobile DNA was initially greeted with widespread skepticism because her interpretation of its strange behavior did not fit with the conventional genetics of the time. However, as evidence for mobile DNA in microbes, plants, and insects increased, the importance of her discovery became widely recognized (see Barbara McClintock) In 1983, McClintock was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
Uses of Transposons

Transposons can be used by scientists to study genetics. Because transposons are inserted into genes, they can be used to knock out genes. This technique turns off a gene to determine its function and has been used experimentally in microorganisms, plants, and animals.
