"DOROTHEA!"
The voice was deep-toned, verging on gruffness, and it lingered over the name, not affectionately, but as if the speaker's mind were absent.
No answer came in words from the girl seated beyond the round table. She lowered the book in her hands, and waited.
"Dorothea!"
"Yes," she said.
"Fetch me the first volume of the Encyclopædia."
"The Encyclopædia?"
"Britannica, of course."
"Downstairs?" Dorothea asked hesitatingly.
"Of course!"—again. "Lowest shelf of the bookcase."
"That long row of big volumes! I think I saw the first volume upstairs."
"Then, my dear, it ought not to be. Everything should always be in its right place."
Colonel Tracy spoke with the air of one enunciating a profound truth, disembosomed by himself for the first time in the history of the world. He was a grey-haired veteran, with large features, a complexion of deep-red rust, and solid though not tall figure. Fifteen years of "retired" life had not undone his Indian military training. When giving an order to daughter or domestic, he was apt still to give it as to a Sepoy. "Ready! Present! Fire!" was the Colonel's style. Domestics were disposed to rebel, where the daughter had to endure.
Dorothea laid down her book, and stood up slowly. There was a controlled stillness about her movements, unusual in girls of eighteen, and not too common in women of middle age. She did not remind her father that he, not she, had conveyed the volume to its present resting-place. One week at home—if this could fairly be called "home"—had shown Dorothea that whatever went wrong would be the fault of anybody rather than of the Colonel. So she left that question alone, and vanished.
The Colonel lifted his head, and looked after her. "Quiet!" he muttered in a gratified tone. "Good thing, too! I hate your bouncing women, slamming the doors, and shaking the house at every step." He had himself a heavy footfall, and he was given to loud shutting of doors, but these were exclusive privileges, not to be accorded to anybody else.
The room which Dorothea left was not attractive. Carpet and curtains were faded; wall-paper and furniture were ugly; ornaments were cheap and in bad taste. There were no dainty knick-knacks on brackets or side-tables. An old-fashioned round table stood in the centre, and was strewn with books—dull books in dull bindings.
London lodgings are not wont to be attractive, especially the second-rate sort. This was the "upstairs parlour" of a very second-rate sort, situated in a side-street of exceptional dreariness.
All the houses on either side of the street were exactly like all the rest. Each had a porch with steps; each had an area with more steps; each had one window of a small dining-room beside the porch, and two windows of a little drawing-room above; each had two bedroom windows yet higher, and most had two garret holes at the top. Each was discoloured with smoke, dingy and dismal. Each had white blinds to the bedroom windows, which seemed to keep up a futile struggle after cleanliness.
These particulars would have been patent in daylight; but daylight vanishes early on a December afternoon in town. Night had drawn its pall over the big city an hour before. A tall candle burnt upon the table, close to the Colonel. He was so used to read and write alone by the light of a single candle, that the need of a second for his daughter had not occurred to him.
She came in, carrying the big volume, laid it down, and stood for a moment beside him, as if to await further orders.
There was nothing "school-girlish" about Dorothea, in the ordinary sense of the word, though she had left school but one week earlier. Of good height, she had a pretty figure, the effect of which was somewhat spoilt by the forward carriage of her head, almost amounting to a poke, and due to short sight. Her face was rounded and pale, and in repose was serious. The wistful eyes looked through a pair of "pincer" glasses, balanced on a neat little nose.
Colonel Tracy was making voluminous notes from a decrepit brown volume, which had lost half its binding. He wrote an atrocious hand, which fact had mattered little hitherto, since nobody needed to read it except himself. Now that he was beginning to wake up to the possession of a daughter who might be useful, a new element came into the question.
"Is that all?" asked Dorothea.
"Humph!" was doubtless meant for thanks, and the girl went towards her seat. But before she could reach it, a supplementary order was issued: "Ha! No! It's not here! Second volume."
"Shall I get the second volume?"
Colonel Tracy glanced up, and really did say "Thanks!" with even a suspicion of apology in the tone.
Dorothea ran down the narrow staircase this time, instead of up. She had to light a candle, and take it into the dining-room. Having found the required volume, some impulse led her to the window, where she peeped through the lowered venetians.
A hansom was dashing past; and two ladies on the pavement seemed to be carrying home an armful of packages. Dorothea could detect a merry ring in their voices as they went. Then came a boy, bearing a big bunch of holly. For this was Christmas Eve.
The Colonel had bought no holly. "Nonsense," he had said that morning, when Dorothea petitioned for some. "You are not a child now, my dear; and I have no money to throw away on rubbish."
Was it rubbish? Dorothea considered the question, as she leant against the window, forgetting for the moment the volume which had to be taken to her father.
"He does not, seem to care much about Christmas," she thought. "I used to feel it dull to stay at school; but this seems more dull. Did Mrs. Kirkpatrick guess how it would be, when she told me I should have worries? She said I must try to draw out my father's sympathies, because he has been so long alone. But how? What can I do? He does not care to talk. I can see that it only bothers him. And he seems to have no friends. Nobody calls to see him, not even any letters come. Will it always be so?"
As if in response, the postman's rap sounded.
"Mrs. Kirkpatrick, I dare say! She will not forget me," the girl said joyously, hastening out.
But the one letter handed to her was addressed "Colonel Tracy."
"I shall hear to-morrow. I did not really expect it sooner," she thought, and she ran lightly upstairs.
"Something for you, father. A Christmas card!" she suggested.
Colonel Tracy looked up. "Christmas card!" he repeated. "Where is the volume?"
"The Encyclopædia! O how stupid of me! The postman came, and I forgot. I'll get it at once."
"Make haste!" hurried her steps. She would have liked to wait and see the envelope opened. Expeditious as she was, that process was over by the time she returned. The Colonel sat bolt upright, gazing at something in his hand, with a singular expression on his sunburnt face. It was a Christmas card, as Dorothea had guessed, and she came fearlessly near, to gaze also. There was a background of dull pale blue, and across the background flew a white dove, bearing in its beak a bunch of leaves—presumably an olive-branch. "Peace and Good-Will" in golden letters occupied one corner.
"Why, father, it is quite an old card," Dorothea exclaimed merrily, anxious to throw herself into his interests. "Look at the soiled edges; and a crease all down the middle. It might be years old."
The Colonel was not communicative. He glanced at her with the same odd expression, and said, "Yes."
"Who can it be from? Some old friend of yours?"
"We were friends—once!"
"And not now?"
"No!" decisively.
"But you exchange Christmas cards?"
"We send—this," after a pause. Colonel Tracy seemed unwilling to explain.
Dorothea knelt on a stool close to the table, resting her hands upon it, much interested.
"Do tell me more," she said. "It is Christmas Eve, and I have nobody else to talk to."
"There is nothing to tell. We had a—a trifling disagreement," said the Colonel. "What makes you wear spectacles?"
"Short sight. Why, father, you know that!"
"I had forgotten. Well, I shall put this away," said the Colonel.
"And send another to your friend?"
"No. Certainly not. Next Christmas, I shall return this."
A light dawned on Dorothea. "Is that it? I see. How strange!"
"Not strange at all. We have done so for some years—eight or nine, I think—alternately."
"Always the same card?"
"Yes."
"And you have never met! And never written!"
"No. Why should we?"
Dorothea was silent for a moment. Then she said, "If you met, you would be friends again."
The Colonel made a dubious sound.
"Was it you who sent the card first, or was it he?"
"Not I."
"And when you first got it, did you wait a whole year to send it back?"
"Certainly."
The wonder in Dorothea's tone was lost upon the gallant Colonel.
"And you will wait a whole year now! Not write a letter, or—"
"I shall wait till next Christmas," said the Colonel.
Thereupon, he pushed the little messenger of peace into a square envelope, wrote upon it, "Christmas Card—Erskine—" and hid it away in his desk.
"Is Erskine his name?"
"Colonel Erskine. We were in the same regiment. He was my senior, slightly; and I believe, he retired first."
"And now he lives at—"
"Craye. My dear, we have talked long enough. I have no more time to spare," said the Colonel, turning with assiduity to vol. ii. of the Encyclopædia.
Dorothea subsided into her chair and into silence. She was not timid, but she did not wish to worry him. Besides, she had something fresh to think about, in the slow progress of reconciliation between the two veterans. "But to have gone on all these years!" she said to herself. "And I wish my father had been the first to send the card."
