Z31 was a German Type 1936A (mob) destroyer, completed in 1942, and served in the Kriegsmarine during World War II. She was built in Germany as part of Plan Z and commissioned on April 11, 1942. She spent most of the war in Arctic and Norwegian waters, participating in the Battle of the Barents Sea on December 31, 1942. She survived the war and was handed over to the French Navy as a trophy, where she served under the name Marceau until 1958.
Design and Construction
On June 28, 1939, Germany ordered nine new Type 1938B destroyers (Z31-Z39), and three more of the same type were ordered in July. This was Germany's naval rearmament program, which called for the construction of 10 battleships, 4 aircraft carriers, 12 battleships, 3 pocket battleships, 5 heavy cruisers, 44 light cruisers, 68 destroyers, and 249 submarines. These ships were to be divided into two battle fleets. The 1938B was a relatively small destroyer compared to its predecessors, the 1936 and 1936A, and was designed to be capable of long range cruising with four 127mm guns mounted in double turrets. It was designed to be capable of long range cruising with four 127mm guns in two turrets. However, when World War II broke out, the order for the 1938B destroyers was cancelled and reverted to the 1936A (mob) type, a slight modification of the previous 1936A type. 1939 September 19, four destroyers (Z31 to Z34) were reordered from the Decimag Consortium, and on that day the Z31 was broken ground on September 1, 1940 (yard number 1001), launched on May 15, 1941, and commissioned on April 11, 1942.
Z31 was 127 meters long, with a draft of 121.9 meters, a beam of 12 meters, and a draft of 3.92 to 4.62 meters (depending on drainage capacity). Her drainage is 2,645 tons standard (2,603 tons) and 3,655 tons fully loaded (3,597 tons). The ship's machinery consisted of six Wagner boilers that fed two sets of Wagner geared steam turbines with high-pressure superheated steam (70 bar [1,029 psi, 7,093 kPa], 450 °C [842 °F]). Rated output was 70,000 shaft horsepower (52,000 kW), speed 38.5 knots (71.3 km/h, 44.3 mph), and range 2,239 nautical miles (4,147 km, 2,577 mi) at 19 knots (35 km/h, 22 mph). Officers and capacity was 321.
The design main armament of the Type 1936A (mob) class, like the base Type 1936A class, was five 15 cm TbtsK C/36 ship guns, with one continuous turret forward and three single turrets aft. However, development of the continuous turret was slow, and Z31 (like other 1936A types) was completed with an additional 15cm single gun in place of the unusable continuous turret, for a total of four 15cm guns. The front guns were replaced with a continuous turret as planned in 1944, but after the continuous turret was badly damaged in a battle in January 1945, the continuous turret was replaced with a single 10.5cm SK L/45 ship's gun. The ship's anti-aircraft armament consisted of two 3.7cm SK C/30 anti-aircraft machine guns (later replaced by the M42 automatic anti-aircraft gun), one four-barrel and five single-barrel, nine 2cm guns; in 1943 a second four-barrel 20mm gun was installed forward of the bridge to replace one single-barrel gun, and in 1945 an additional 3.7cm gun The final German anti-aircraft armament consisted of 14 3.7-cm guns and 12 2-cm guns; eight 53.3-cm torpedo tubes were fitted in two quadruplets, allowing the ship to carry up to 60 mines; and two 3.7-cm guns were fitted in 1945, replacing one single gun forward of the bridge. Commissioning in Germany
After commissioning, the ship underwent a lengthy maintenance process typical of German destroyers during World War II: damaged in a collision with a schooner on November 6, 1941, Z31 was assigned to the operational fleet in Norwegian waters in December 1942; on December 30, 1942, Z31 was assigned to the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper and Lützow, along with destroyers Friedrich Ekolzen, Richard Beitzen, Theodor Riedel, Z29, and Z30, departed Alta Fjord in northern Norway on Operation Regenbogen to attack Arctic convoy JW 51B. The Germans encountered the convoy on the morning of December 31 and, in poor visibility, engaged the convoy's escorts in a battle in the Barents Sea. Hipper sank the British destroyer Achates and the minesweeper Bramble, damaged the destroyers Onslow and Obdurate, and Lützow damaged the destroyer Obedient, but the British cruiser Sheffield and Jamaica's covering force damaged Hipper and sank the Richard Bezuyenne, The engagement was terminated. None of the 15 merchant ships in the convoy were damaged.
On February 5-6, 1943, Z31, Theodor Riedel, and the minesweeper Brummer laid a minefield off Kildin Island, and on March 10-11, two destroyers escorted Lützow from Kaafjord to Narvik On September 6, 1943, Z31 was joined by the battleships Tirpitz and On September 6, 1943, Z31 departed Alta Fjord as part of a fleet consisting of the battleships Tirpitz and Scharnhorst and nine destroyers and embarked on Operation Jitronella, a raid on the Allied-controlled island of Spitsbergen. After moving to the south and conducting patrols, Z31 laid a defensive minefield at the entrance to Skagerrak from December 4 to 7.
After this operation, Z31 began refit at Wesermünde, which continued until August 1944, when it returned to Norway In October 1944, Z31 participated in escort operations as the Germans withdrew the 20th Mountain Army from northern Finland and Norway in response to the Soviet Petsamo Kirkenes offensive The destroyer was part of the convoy. The destroyer continued escort and patrol duties for the remainder of the year, along with minesweeping operations off Honningsvåg (with Z29 on December 16 and Z33 on December 27) and off Hammerfest on January 3, 1945 (again with Z33).
On January 25, 1945, German Destroyer Squadron 4, consisting of Z31, Z34, and Z38, departed Tromsø for the Baltic Sea; on January 28, the three destroyers were intercepted by the British cruisers Mauritius and Diadem in the Sognefjord north of Bergen; Z31 was hit seven times by the British cruiser, her forward turret was badly damaged, and she was taken out by the British cruiser on January 29, Fifty-five men were killed and 24 wounded. After escaping casualties, Z31 entered Bergen for temporary repairs and underwent further repairs in Horten and Oslo before reaching the Baltic Sea.
On March 22, Z31 joined forces with Z34 and Lützow to bombard advancing Soviet forces near Gotenhafen, West Prussia (now Gdynia, Poland), and on March 23 towed the battleship Gneisenau's hull to the entrance of Gotenhafen harbor, ready to sink it as a blockship. (Gneisenau was dismantled on March 27.) On March 27, a 15 cm shell accidentally exploded in one of Z31's guns, killing four and wounding 18. Nevertheless, Z31 continued to assist in the evacuation of German troops and civilians from Gotenhafen and Hera until it was damaged by Soviet bombing and withdrew westward with Prinz Eugen and Lützow on April 8. On her way to Kiel on April 27, she was again damaged by Soviet air strikes; she arrived at Brunsbüttel on April 30 and remained there until the end of the war on May 8.
service in France
For other ships of the same name, see French ship Marceau. After the war, Z31 was transferred to the U.K. After trials in August 1945, she was handed over to France and transferred to the French Navy at Cherbourg on February 2, 1946, and commissioned as Marceau on April 1. and her anti-aircraft equipment was replaced by eight Bofors 40mm guns, and she underwent a major refit to equip her with U.S. radar. She was assigned to Toulon and served there for several years. She regularly visited Oran, Dakar, and Bizerte for exercises with the French fleet; was placed in reserve in 1953 and became a hulk (Q103) on 1 February 1954; damaged on 2 January 1958, sold for scrap later that year, and dismantled in the early 1960s.
