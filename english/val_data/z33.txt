Z33 was a 1936A destroyer built for the German Navy during World War II. completed in 1943, she was damaged in an air raid on Spitsbergen Island in September and spent all of 1944 in Norwegian waters. in July, she was damaged by British aircraft attacking the battleship Tirpitz. in October, Z33 was ordered to escort a convoy of troops from northern Norway when the Germans began evacuating the area. In early 1945, while sailing to the Baltic Sea, she ran aground and was badly damaged. While being towed to port for repairs, Z33 and her escorts were attacked by Allied fighter-bombers; Z33 finally arrived in the Baltic in early April, but was placed in reserve due to lack of fuel. She was transferred to Cuxhaven and decommissioned just before the end of the war.
Z33 was assigned to the Soviet Union at the end of 1945 and delivered in early 1946; renamed Provornyy, she subsequently served in the Soviet Navy; in 1954 she became a training ship and the following year was converted to an accommodation ship; in 1960 she was badly damaged by fire and was scrapped in 1962; in 1963 she was transferred to the Soviet Union, and in 1964 was transferred to the Soviet Union.
Design and Description
The Type 1936A (Mob) destroyers were slightly larger and heavier armed than the preceding Type 1936A class. They were 127 meters (416 feet 8 inches) long and 121.9 meters (399 feet 11 inches) at the draft line. The beam was 12 meters (39 feet 4 inches) and the maximum draft was 4.62 meters (15 feet 2 inches). Two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, used steam supplied by six Wagner water tube boilers to produce 70,000 m horsepower (51,000 kW; 69,000 shp) was designed to be generated. The design speed was 36 knots (67 km/h) and the maximum speed was 36.1 knots (66.9 km/h).The Type 1936A (mob) destroyers carried enough fuel oil to give a range of 2,239 nautical miles (4,147 km; 2,577 miles) at 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph). The ship had a Her crew consisted of 11 to 15 officers and 305 to 21 enlisted men, with an additional four officers and 19 enlisted men when serving as fleet flagship.
The armament of the 1936A (mob) ships consisted of five 15 cm TbtsK C/36 guns mounted in a series turret forward and three in a single turret with gun shield aft of the main superstructure. Antiaircraft armament varied, with the Z33 carrying four 3.7cm Flak M42 guns in a pair of linked turrets next to the rear funnel, and ten 2cm C/38 guns in two quadruple turrets and two single turrets. The torpedo launchers were two 53.3 cm torpedo tubes. Each rack was equipped with a pair of loading torpedoes. Aft deck was equipped with a mine track capable of carrying up to 60 mines. a passive underwater listening device called "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) was fitted to detect submarines. a S-Gerät sonar was probably also fitted. The upper bridge was equipped with FuMO 24/25 radar, FuMB 3 Bali, FuMB 6 Palau, FuMB 26 Tunis, and FuMB 31 radar detectors.
Alterations.
After completion, FuMB 4 Sumatra radar detectors were added, and in 1944-1945 FuMO 63 Hohentwiel radar was installed in place of the aft searchlight; in early April 1945, one 15cm gun was transferred to sister ship Z34 to replace a damaged weapon. Around the same time, her anti-aircraft guns were removed. When the destroyer was ordered to the German Gulf at the end of the same month, it was replaced by weapons taken from the wreckage of the heavy cruiser Lützow. By the end of the war, Z33's anti-aircraft equipment consisted of 10 3.7-cm guns with five stacks, and 12 2-cm guns with one quadruple stack, two double stacks, and four single stacks. History of commissioning
Z33 was ordered on June 28, 1939 from Seebeckwerft (shipyard no. 665) as a Type 1938B destroyer, but the German Navy cancelled the order in September 1939 and reordered her on September 19, 1939 from AG Weser (Desimag) (shipyard no. W1003) as a Type 1936A (Mob) destroyer The ship was broken ground on December 22, 1940 at the Bremen shipyard in Desimagh and launched on September 15, 1941. Construction was delayed due to lack of manpower and materials, and Z33 was not commissioned until February 6, 1943.
She sailed for Norway immediately after work was completed on July 22, and took part in the German air raid on Spitsbergen Island in September, Operation Jitronella, and was hit 33 times by coastal gunfire, killing 3 crew members and wounding 25. Z33 was one of the escorts of the battleship Scharnhorst in Operation Ostfront on December 25, and was ordered to the Soviet Union as one of the escorts of the British battleship Scharnhorst. and attempted to intercept the British convoy JW 55B bound for the Soviet Union. All of Battleship Scharnhorst's escorts were detached the next day to increase the likelihood of intercepting the convoy and did not participate in the subsequent Battle of the North Cape; they remained in Norwegian waters until 1944; on 17 July 1944, Z33 was part of Operation Mascot, an attack on the battleship Tirpitz, which was launched by Royal Navy From October, Z33 escorted convoys in Operation Nordlicht (Operation Evacuation of Northern Norway). on 27 December, Z33, together with her sister ship Z31, laid a minefield off Honningsvag. The two ships laid another minefield off Hammerfest on 3 January 1945.
Z33 departed for Germany on February 5, but ran aground two days later in Bullfjord. The impact severely damaged the port propeller shaft and propeller, breaking both turbines and causing flooding. While under tow to Trondheim, the destroyer was attacked by Allied Bristol Beaufighter fighter-bombers two days later while anchored at Ferde Fjord. The attack further damaged the destroyer, but she and her escort shot down seven Beaufighters and suffered heavy casualties, which later became known as the "Black Friday" air strike. Once repairs were completed, the ship departed for Svinemünde on March 26 and arrived there on April 2. Due to German fuel shortages, the ship was laid up and saw no further combat. Shortly after her arrival, all anti-aircraft guns were removed, and before Z33 left Svinemünde on April 27 to be decommissioned at Cuxhaven, her anti-aircraft guns were replaced with guns taken from a sunken ship at Lützow.
After the war, Z33 called at Wilhelmshaven, where she was overhauled to keep her in navigable condition; she was assigned to the Soviet Union at the end of 1945 and delivered on January 2, 1946, before departing for Liepāja, Latvia. Renamed Provolny (Проворный, "light") and assigned to the Red Flag Baltic Fleet, she was temporarily made a training ship on November 30, 1954, and reclassified as an accommodation ship on April 22, 1955; in 1960, Provolny was badly damaged by fire and sank at anchor; two years later she was re She was afloat and then scrapped.
