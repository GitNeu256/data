Z27 was one of 15 Type 1936A destroyers built for the German Navy during World War II. completed in 1941, she was transferred to Norwegian waters later that year and spent the next several years escorting convoys and laying minefields. after sinking a Soviet oil tanker in late 1942, she headed to Germany for refit Upon completion in mid-1943, Z27 returned to Norway and participated in Operation Jitronella, an air raid on the island of Spitsbergen in September.
The following month she headed to France, and upon arrival became the flagship of the 8th Destroyer Fleet. The fleet was tasked to escort several blockade runners through the Bay of Biscay in December; the first passed safely, but the second was discovered and sunk by a German ship en route to the rendezvous point. intercepted by two British light cruisers, Z27 was sunk in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay on December 28, losing about 300 crewmen. She lost about 300 crew members.
Design and Features
The Type 1936A destroyers were slightly larger and heavier armed than the preceding Type 1936 class. Its overall length was 127 meters (416 feet 8 inches) and its length at the draft line was 121.90 meters (399 feet 11 inches). The beam was 12 meters (39 feet 4 inches) and the maximum draft was 4.62 meters (15 feet 2 inches). Two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving a single propeller shaft, were capable of 70,000 PS (51, 000 kW; 69,000 kW) using steam supplied from six Wagner water tube boilers. Z27 was designed to generate 70,000 kW (51, 000 kW; 69,000 shp) using steam supplied by six Wagner water-tube boilers, and had a design speed of 36 knots (67 km/h; 41 mph). Z27 could carry up to 791 tons (779 t) of fuel oil and travel 2,500 nautical miles (4,600 km; 2,900 miles) range. The crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors.
She was armed with one 15cm TbtsK C/36 cannon forward of the superstructure and three aft. Antiaircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm C/30 guns mounted on two mounts next to the rear funnel and seven 2 cm C/30 guns on a single mount; Z27 carried eight overwater 53.3 cm torpedo tubes on two powered mounts. Two reloads were provided on each mount. In addition, the aft deck was equipped with a mine track that could carry up to 60 mines. A "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) passive hydrophone was fitted to detect submarines and probably also S-Gerät sonar. The upper bridge was equipped with a FuMO 24/25 radar.
Modifications.
Although exact data is not available, Z27 was probably fitted with a pair of 2cm quadruple guns during 1942, replacing several single guns.
Construction and Career
Z27 was ordered from AG Weser (Deschimag) on 23 April 1938; she was broken ground on 27 December 1939 at the Bremen shipyard in Deschimag under yard number W961, launched on 1 August 1940, and commissioned on 26 February 1941. Her first commanding officer was Korvettenkapitän (Lieutenant Commander) Karl Smidt. While still in training, she was assigned to escort the Baltic Fleet, temporarily formed around the battleship Tirpitz, from September 23 to 29, when it sailed into the Åland Sea to prevent the breakout of the Soviet Red Flag Baltic Fleet from the Gulf of Finland.
Two months later, Z27, accompanied by her sister ships Z23 and Z25, left Germany for Norway, arriving in Tromsø on 6 December, and was one of four destroyers that sailed into the Barents Sea on 16 December to search for Allied ships off the Kola Peninsula. The next day, Z25's radar spotted two ships at a distance of 37.5 kilometers in a thick fog. The Germans thought they were Soviet destroyers, but in fact they were two British minesweepers, Hazard and Speedy, which were sailing to rendezvous with Convoy QP 6. The Germans intercepted them but were unable to fire accurately due to thick fog and icing; Z25 and Z27 attempted to fire 11 torpedoes but were only able to fire one each; Z27 later developed propeller shaft problems and sailed for Germany on January 5, 1942, to begin refitting. The ship returned to Norway in May and participated in the outposts of Operation Rösselsprung, which attempted to intercept Convoy PQ 17 in early July. The heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer and her sister Lützow formed one group at Narvik with Z27 and her four sisters, while Tirpitz and the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper formed another group. On the way to the rendezvous at Alta Fjord, three destroyers escorting Lützow and Tirpitz ran aground, forcing the entire group to abandon the operation; between October 13 and 15, Z27 and her sister ship Z30, destroyers Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt laid a minefield off the Kanin Peninsula at the mouth of the White Sea and sank the Soviet icebreaker Mikoyan. Three weeks later, the same four destroyers escorted Admiral Hipper as he attempted to intercept an Allied merchant ship heading alone to a Soviet port in early November. Z27, which had been searching for the convoy at the tail end of the patrol line, was alerted to the tanker's presence by Admiral Hipper's float plane on November 7 and began pursuit. The destroyer first intercepted and sank the submarine-chasing vessel BO-78, then caught up with and sank the westbound 8,000 gross register ton (GRT) Soviet oil tanker Donbass, rescuing survivors from both ships.
On 2 December, Z27 headed for Bremen to begin a refit, returning to Norway on 15 June 1943; with Z30, she conducted several minesweeping missions off southern Norway between 19 and 28 June; in September, she participated in an air raid on Spitsbergen Island, landing troops on the island; on 24 She was one of four destroyers escorting Lützow to Kiel, Germany, and on October 31 she went to France with destroyer ZH 1. On the voyage to Le Verdon-sur-Mer, both ships were slightly damaged by debris from British coastal guns as they passed through the English Channel; on November 5, they were attacked by British motor torpedo boats off Cap d'Antifer, damaging several ships. The ship, now the flagship of Fleet Commander Hans Erdmenger (Kapitän zur See), commander of the 8. Zellsteller fleet, was one of the escorts of the 6,951 GRT blockade transport MV Osorno through the Bay of Biscay.
Battle of the Bay of Biscay
Another blockade ship, the 2,729 GRT refrigerated freighter MV Alsterhofer, followed Osorno a few days later, and on December 27, four destroyers, including Z27 of the 8. Flotilla, and six torpedo boats of the 4. Torpedoboot Flotilla (4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla) were to escort Osorno through the bay. The ship set sail. The Allies, aware of the presence of these blockade flotillas through Ultra's code-breaking activities, deployed cruisers and aircraft in the western Atlantic to intercept them in Operation Stonewall. Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers of the Royal Air Force's 311th Squadron sunk the Ulster Ufer that afternoon.
The German ships were unaware of the sinking until the following afternoon and continued on to the rendezvous point. They were spotted by American Liberator bombers on the morning of the 28th, and the British light cruisers Glasgow and Enterprise, assigned to Stonewall, maneuvered to intercept them. By this time, the weather had deteriorated considerably, and the German ships were sailing for home, hampered by rough seas that splashed against their forward guns. In addition, the spray made visibility extremely poor, hampering the rangefinders and sights on the guns and torpedoes. Using radar, Glasgow opened fire first at 13:46 at a range of 19,600 meters (21,400 yards) on the nearest German ship, Z27, and her sister ship, Z23, followed by Enterprise a few minutes later; Z23 closed her range to 17,000 meters (19,000yd) before firing six torpedoes, but all missed. About that time, the destroyers began to counterattack; at 14:28, Z27 fired four torpedoes, which also missed. Shortly after Erdmenger decided to split the force and ordered Z23, Z27, and three torpedo boats to reverse course to the north. 7 minutes later, Z27 fired her remaining torpedoes, all missing their targets. The British ships pursued the group to the north, and a shell from the Enterprise soon hit the destroyer's No. 2 boiler room, severing the starboard main steam line, forcing the evacuation of the boiler room and knocking out the starboard turbine. The effects of the damage began to accumulate and other boilers began to fail over the next hour or so, as did the feed pump on the port turbine. Hours later, in pursuit of the scattered Germans, Glasgow spotted the drifting Z27 and, after closing in at close range, sank her with gunfire at 16:41. A total of 93 men were rescued by a German submarine, a Spanish destroyer, and the Irish merchant vessel MV Kerlogue, but about 300 crew members were killed.
