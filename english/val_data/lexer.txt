"Lexer" will be redirected here. For people with this name, see Lexer (last name).
Lexical tokenization is the conversion of text into lexical tokens of meaning (semantically or syntactically) belonging to categories defined by the Lexical Analysis program, these categories include nouns, verbs, adjectives, punctuation, etc. For programming languages, categories include identifiers, operators, grouping symbols, and data types. Lexical tokenization is not the same process as stochastic tokenization used for data preprocessing in large language models, but rather uses byte-pair encoding to encode text into numeric tokens.
Rule-based programs
A rule-based program that performs lexical tokenization is called a tokenizer or scanner, but the scanner is also a Lexer stage 1 term. Lexer forms the first phase of the front end of the compiler in processing. Analysis is generally done in 1 pass. Lexers and parsers are most often used for compilers, but can be used for other computer language tools such as prettyprinters and linter. A scan that splits the input string into syntactic units called lexemes and classifies these into token classes; and the evaluation converts the lexical to the processed value.
Lexers are generally very simple, and most of the complexity is deferred to the parser or semantic analysis phase, which is often generated by lexar generators, especially lex or derivatives. However, Lexers may contain some complexity, such as phrase structure processing to facilitate input and simplify the parser, and may support more features.
Disambiguation of "lexemes"
What is called a "lexeme" in rule-based natural language processing is not the same as what is called a lexeme in linguistics. What is called a "lexeme" in rule-based natural language processing is linguistically equivalent only in analytical languages such as English, but not in highly synthesized languages such as fusion languages. What is called a lexeme in rule-based natural language processing is similar to what is called a word in linguistics (not to be confused with a word in computer architecture), but in some cases may be similar to a morpheme.
Large language modelsÂ§ Not to be confused with stochastic tokenization, or tokenization (data security).
A lexical token is a string that has an assigned and thus identified meaning, as opposed to a probability token used in a large language model. A lexical token consists of a token name and an optional token value. A token name is a rule-based lexical unit category. Common token names are:
*Identifier: The name chosen by the programmer;
* Keyword: The name of the programming language already;
* Delimiter (also called punctuation): Punctuation character and pair delimiter;
*Operator: A symbol that manipulates an argument to produce a result;
 Literals: Numeric literals, logical literals, text literals, reference literals;
* Comments: lines, blocks (depends on the compiler if the compiler implements comments as tokens);
* Blank: A group of characters that cannot be printed. This type of token is almost always discarded.
Lexical analysis of this expression generates the following set of tokens:
[(identifier, x), (operator, =), (identifier,a), (operator, +), (identifier,b), (operator, *), (literal, 2), (delimiter, ;)]
The token name is what is called a part of speech in linguistics.
Lexical tokenization is the conversion of raw text (semantically or syntactically) into meaningful lexical tokens, and "lexical resulting tokens such as identifiers, operators, grouping symbols, and data types are passed to other processing forms." This process can be seen as a subtask that parses the input.
For example, in a text string, it would look like this:
	If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us and we will be happy to answer any questions you may have.
Strings are not implicitly segmented by spaces, as natural language speakers do. The 43 characters that are the raw input must be explicitly split into 9 tokens with the specified space delimiter (i.e. matching the string "" or the regex /\s{1}/).
If a token class represents multiple possible lexemes, the lexemes often store enough information to reproduce the original lexemes and can be used for semantic analysis. The parser typically retrieves this information from the lexer and stores it in an abstract syntax tree. This is necessary to avoid information loss when numbers are also valid identifiers.
Tokens are identified based on Lexer's specific rules. Some of the methods used to identify tokens include regular expressions, specific character sequences called flags, specific delimiters called delimiters, and explicit definitions by dictionaries. Special characters, including punctuation, are commonly used by Lexers to identify tokens because they are naturally used in written and programming languages. Lexical analyzers generally do nothing with the token combination, the task left for the parser. For example, a typical lexer recognizes parentheses as tokens, but does nothing to ensure that each "(" matches ")".
When Lexer feeds the token to the parser, the representation used is usually an enumerated list of numeric representations. For example, "identifier" is represented by 0, "assignment operator" is represented by 1, and "addition operator" is represented by 2.
Tokens are often defined by regular expressions and are understood by lexical analyzer generators such as lex. Lexical analyzer (automatically generated by tools like lex and hand-crafted) reads a stream of characters, identifies lexemes in the stream, and classifies them into tokens. This is called tokenization. If Lexer detects an invalid token, it reports an error.
Tokenization is followed by parsing. From there, the interpreted data may be loaded into the data structure for general use, interpretation, or compilation.
Lexical grammar
More information: Vocabulary Grammar
Programming language specifications often contain a set of rules called lexical grammar that define lexical syntax. Lexical syntax is usually a regular language, and grammatical rules consist of regular expressions that define a set of possible character sequences (lexical) of tokens. Lexer recognizes the string, and for each type of string found, the lexical program performs an action and most simply generates a token.
Two important general vocabulary categories are blanks and comments. These are also defined in the grammar and handled by lexer, but are discarded (not generating tokens) and can be separated up to 2 tokens (like if x instead of ifx). There are 2 important exceptions to this. First, in an offside rule language that separates blocks by indentation, initial whitespace is important because it determines the block structure and is generally handled at the Lexer level.See the phrase structure below. For example, prettyprinter also needs to output comments, and some debugging tools may provide a message to the programmer indicating the original source code. In the 1960s, especially in ALGOL, whitespace and comments were removed as part of the line reconstruction phase (the initial phase of the compiler front-end), but this separate phase was removed.
Details
Scanner
The first stage, the scanner, is usually based on a finite state machine (fsm). It encodes in it information about possible sequences of characters that can be included in any of the tokens it deals with (individual instances of these character sequences are called lexemes). For example, an integer lexical can include any sequence of numeric characters of digits. In many cases, a character other than the first whitespace can be used to infer the type of subsequent token, and subsequent input characters are processed 1 at a time until they reach a character that is not in the set of characters allowed for that token (this is called the max munch, or the longest match rule). In some languages, lexeme creation rules are more complex and may involve backtracking previously read characters. For example, in the C language, a 1-character 'L' is not enough to distinguish between identifiers beginning with 'L' and wide-character string literals.
Evaluator
However, a lexeme is only a string of characters (e.g. a string literal, a sequence of strings) that is known to be of a certain kind. To construct the token, the lexical analyzer needs an evaluator, which is a second step, which generates values beyond the characters of the lexical. By combining the lexeme type with its value, you can properly construct the token and give it to the parser. These evaluator functions can't return anything because some tokens, such as parentheses, actually have no value: they only need the type. Similarly, the evaluator can suppress the lexical completely and hide it from the parser, which can be useful for whitespace and comments. An identifier evaluator is usually simple (literally representing an identifier), but it may contain some stopping. An evaluator of an integer literal can pass a string (deferring evaluation to the semantic parsing phase), or for a simple quoted string literal with respect to a different base or floating point number, the evaluator must remove only the quotes, but the evaluator of an escaped string literal must have an escaped string literal. A lexer is built in to unescape the sequence.
For example, the source code of a computer program uses the following strings
net_worth_future=(Assets-liabilities);
It may be converted to the next lexical token stream.:
Identifier net_worth_future
Equal
OPEN_PARENTHESIS
Identifier assets
Negative
Identifier
CLOSE_PARENTHESIS
Semicolon
You may need to write Lexer by hand because of existing parser license restrictions. This is practical if the list of tokens is small, but in general, lexers are generated by automated tools. These tools typically accept regular expressions that describe the tokens allowed in the input stream. Each regular expression is associated with a production rule of lexical grammar in a programming language that evaluates lexemes that match regular expressions. These tools can generate compiled and executable source code, or build state transition tables for finite state machines (which are plugged into template code for compilation and execution).
Regular expressions compactly represent the patterns that characters in a lexeme may follow. For example, for English-based languages, an identifier token can be any English alphabetic or underscore followed by any number of ASCII alphanumeric and/or underscore instances. This can be compactly represented by the string [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*. This means "0 or more a-z, A-Z, _ or 0-9 after any letter a-z, A-Z or _."
Regular expressions and the finite state machine they generate are not powerful enough to handle recursive patterns such as "n starting parentheses followed by statements and n ending parentheses followed.""They can't keep the count, and they can't make sure that n is the same on both sides unless there is a finite set of allowable values for n." The parser can push the brackets on the stack, then pop them off, and try to see if the stack is empty at the end (if the container is empty).
Obstacles
Lexical tokenization usually occurs at the word level. However, it can be difficult to define what a "word" means. In many cases, tokenizers rely on simple heuristics.:
* Punctuation and whitespace may or may not be included in the list of resulting tokens.
* All consecutive strings of alphabet letters are part of 1 token and are the same as numbers as well.
*Tokens are separated by whitespace characters, such as spaces and newlines, or punctuation characters.
For languages that use word-to-word spaces (such as most and most programming languages that use the Latin alphabet), this approach is fairly straightforward, but again, larger structures such as contractions, hyphenated words, emoticons, and uris (which count as a single token for some purposes) can be used. There are many edge cases, such as: A typical example is "New York-based" and a naive tokenizer can break in space even though there is (definitely) a better break in the hyphen.
Tokenization is especially difficult in languages written in scriptio continua that do not indicate word boundaries, such as ancient Greek, Chinese, and Thai. Cohesive languages such as Korean also complicate the tokenization task.
Some of the ways to deal with more difficult problems include developing more complex heuristics, querying general special-case tables, or adapting tokens to language models that identify collocations in later processing steps.
Lexar Generator
Lexa is often generated by Lexa generators similar to parser generators, and such tools often come together. The most established is lex, which is paired with the yacc parser generator, but is part of many reimplementation, like flex (which is often paired with GNU Bison). These generators are a form of domain-specific language that takes in lexical specifications (typically regular expressions with markup) and outputs a lexical analyzer.
These tools bring very fast development, but this is very important in the early stages of development. In addition, they often provide advanced features such as pre- and post-conditions that are difficult to program manually. However, auto-generated lexers can be inflexible, so you may need to fix them manually or write them all manually.
Lexer performance is a concern, and optimizations are valuable, and in stable languages (like C and HTML) where Lexers run very often. Lexas generated with lex/flex are fairly fast, but with a more tuned generator, two to three times the improvements are possible. Sometimes a handwritten lexer is used, but modern lexers generate lexers that are faster than most hand-coded ones. The lex/flex family of generators uses a table-driven approach that is much less efficient than a direct coded approach. In the latter approach, the generator generates an engine that jumps directly to the follow-up state via a goto statement. Tools like Re2c have been proven to produce engines that are twice to three times faster than engines made by flex. In general, it is difficult to write an analyzer with better performance than the engine produced by these latter tools by hand.
Phrase structure
Lexical analysis mainly splits the input stream of characters into tokens and only groups and classifies the characters into fragments. Most simply, Lexer can omit the token or insert the added token. Omitting tokens, especially whitespace and comments, is very common when the compiler doesn't need these. It's less common, but you can insert an added token. This is mainly done to simplify the parser, to group tokens into statements or to group statements into blocks.
Continuation of a line
Line continuation is a feature in some languages where a newline is usually the terminator of a sentence. In most cases, if you end a line with a backslash (immediately followed by a newline), the line will continue.The next line is joined to the previous one. This is generally done in lexers: the backslash and the newline are discarded, rather than the newline being tokenized. Examples include bash, other shell scripts, and Python.
Insert semicolon
Many languages use a semicolon as the terminator of a sentence. In most cases, this is mandatory, but in some languages, the semicolon is optional in many contexts. This is done primarily at the Lexer level, where Lexer outputs a semicolon in the token stream, even though it does not exist in the input character stream, which is called semicolon insertion or automatic semicolon insertion. In these cases, the semicolon is part of the formal phrase grammar of the language, but may not be included in the input text because it can be inserted by Lexer. Optional semicolons and other terminators and separators may also be processed at the parser level, especially in the case of subsequent commas and semicolons.
Semicolon insertion is a function of Bcpl and its distant descendants Go, but it does not exist in B or C.The insertion of semicolons exists in JavaScript, but the rules are somewhat complex and very criticized.Some recommend using a semicolon at all times to avoid bugs, while others use an initial semicolon called a defensive semicolon at the beginning of an ambiguous statement.
Semicolon insertion (languages that contain semicolon-terminated statements) and line continuation (languages that contain newline-terminated statements) can be considered complementary.A semicolon insert usually adds a token, although a newline does not generate a token.Line continuation, on the other hand, usually ensures that a newline generates a token, but not a token.
Offside rule
More information: Offside Rules
The offside rule (a block determined by indentation) can be implemented in lexer like Python.If you increase the indent, Lexer will issue an indent token, and if you decrease the indent, Lexer will issue 1 or more dedent tokens. These tokens correspond to the opening curly braces { and closing curly braces} in languages that use curly braces for blocks, meaning that the phrase grammar does not depend on whether curly braces or indents are used. This requires a lexical retention state, i.e. an indentation level stack, which can detect indentation changes when this changes, so lexical grammar is not context-free.INDENT-DEDENT depends on contextual information at the previous indent level.
Context-sensitive lexical analysis
In general, lexical grammar is context-free, or almost so, and therefore does not require looking back, looking ahead, or backtracking, which allows for a simple, clean, and efficient implementation. This also allows easy one-way communication from lexer to parser, without having to return information to lexer.
However, there are exceptions. Simple examples include semicolon insertion in Go (you need to look back at 1 token), concatenation of consecutive string literals in Python (to see if the next token is another string literal), and offside rules in python (counting indent levels (actually the stack for each indent level). You can also use the following methods: *********** All of these examples only require lexical context and make lexical analysis somewhat more complicated, but it doesn't look like a parser and later phases.
A more complex example is the Lexer hack in c, where typedef names and variable names form lexically identical but different token classes, so the token classes of a series of characters cannot be determined until the semantic parsing phase. So, in the hack, Lexer calls a semantic analyzer (such as a symbol table) to see if the sequence needs a typedef name. In this case, the information needs to come back to the Lexer not only from the parser, but from the semantic analyzer, which complicates the design.
