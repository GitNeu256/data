The Prinz Eugen was a heavy cruiser of the German Kriegsmarine during World War II. She was laid down in April 1936, launched in August 1938, and commissioned in August 1940. The Prinz Eugen was named after Prince Eugene of Savoy, a distinguished 18th-century general in the service of the Holy Roman Empire.
The Prinz Eugen was one of the most powerful cruisers in the world at the time of her commissioning. She was armed with eight 203-mm guns, twelve 105-mm guns, and twelve 37-mm guns. She also carried eight torpedo tubes.
The Prinz Eugen saw action during Operation Rhein√ºbung, an attempted breakout into the Atlantic Ocean with the battleship Bismarck in May 1941. The two ships destroyed the British battlecruiser Hood and moderately damaged the battleship Prince of Wales in the Battle of the Denmark Strait.
After the loss of the Bismarck, the Prinz Eugen continued to operate in the Atlantic. She sank several merchant ships and took part in the Battle of the Barents Sea in December 1942.
In 1943, the Prinz Eugen was transferred to the Mediterranean Sea. She participated in the Battle of the Kursk in July 1943 and the Battle of the Aegean Sea in February 1944.
In November 1944, the Prinz Eugen was scuttled in the Baltic Sea to prevent her from being captured by the Soviet Union. She was raised in 1946 and broken up for scrap.
The Prinz Eugen was a formidable warship that played a significant role in World War II. She was one of the most powerful cruisers in the world at the time of her commissioning and saw action in some of the most important battles of the war.
