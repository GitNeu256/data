Alternative education, also called non-traditional or alternative education, is a broad term that refers to all forms of education beyond traditional education (for all age groups and levels of education). This includes both forms of education designed for students with special needs (from teen pregnancy to mental retardation) and for general audiences who have adopted alternative educational philosophies and methods. The latter alternative forms of education are often the result of educational reform and are based on a variety of philosophies that are fundamentally different from traditional compulsory education. Some have a strongly political, academic or philosophical orientation, while others are informal associations of teachers and students dissatisfied with certain aspects of traditional education. These alternative schools, which range from charter schools, alternative schools, independent schools, and homeschools, often emphasize small class sizes, close relationships between students and teachers, and a sense of community. In some places, especially in the United States, the term "alternative" often refers to a form of education for "at-risk" or special needs students, such as in this definition from the Massachusetts Department of Education. Alternatives used by many educators include nontraditional, nonconventional, and nonstandard, although these terms are used somewhat less frequently and may have negative connotations or multiple meanings. Those who engage in forms of education with a different educational philosophy (as opposed to the target audience of students) also frequently use words such as authentic, holistic, and progressive. However, each of these terms has a different meaning that may be more specific or ambiguous than just alternative. Overview Although pedagogical debates have a very long history, "alternative education" implies a certain orthodoxy to which alternatives are opposed. In general, the term refers to the last two or perhaps three centuries, when standardized and then compulsory education emerged in primary and secondary schools. Many critics of this period suggested that young people should be given an education radically different from what it actually is: 19th century Swiss humanist Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, American transcendentalist Amos Bronson Olcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, progressive education founders John Dewey and Francis Parker, pedagogical pioneers Maria Montessori and Rudolf Steiner (founder of the Waldorf School), and others argued that education was an art that cultivated the moral, emotional, physical, psychological, and spiritual aspects of the developing child. They argued that it should be understood. Anarchists such as Leo Tolstoy and Francisco Ferrer y Guardia emphasized that education was a force for political liberation, secularism, and the elimination of class discrimination. More recently, social critics such as John Caldwell Holt, Paul Goodman, Frederick Mayer, and Ivan Illich have viewed education from a more individualistic, anarchist, and liberal perspective. Other authors have also criticized mainstream Western education from a variety of leftist and radical political positions, ranging from revolutionary Paulo Freire to American educators such as Herbert Kohl and Jonathan Kozol. Modern Forms There are many educational options at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. These generally fall into four broad categories: school choice, alternative schools, independent schools, and home schooling. These general categories can be broken down into specific practices and methodologies. School choice. Public school options include fully independent schools in their own environment, as well as classes, programs, and even semi-independent "schools within schools." Public school options are open to all students in a given neighborhood, although some are on waiting lists. These include charter schools, which combine private initiatives with public funding, and magnet schools, which focus on a particular subject, such as the performing arts. Alternative Schools In education, alternative schools, sometimes called mini-schools or remedial schools, are public or private schools with special education programs, especially traditional Elementary or Middle schools, that offer a more flexible curriculum than traditional schools. Some schools have a strong political, academic, or philosophical orientation, while others represent special groups of teachers and students dissatisfied with traditional education. Today, alternative schools are not only for students with special educational needs, but also for those who want a different school experience. Similar programs exist in higher education for adults returning to school. Independent Schools . Independent, or private, schools are more flexible in their staffing and teaching methods. The most common are Montessori schools, Waldorf schools (the latter are also called Steiner schools after their founder), and Friends schools. Other independent schools include democratic free schools such as Sands School, Summerhill School, and Sudbury Valley School; Krishnamurti schools; open classroom schools; schools based on experiential education; International Baccalaureate schools; and Round Square Schools and Round Square Schools, which use an international curriculum. Increasingly, traditional forms of independent schools also exist within state public education. Most independent schools offer at least partial scholarships. Home schooling. Families seeking alternatives for educational, philosophical, or religious reasons, or who do not believe there are alternative educational institutions nearby, may decide to home educate their children. Some call themselves unschoolers because they follow an interest-based approach rather than a set curriculum. Others enroll in umbrella schools that offer a curriculum. Although many choose this option for religious reasons, people practicing homeschooling come from a variety of religions and philosophies. Correctional Education . Other. There are some interesting gray areas. For example, people who practice home education organize themselves into resource centers, sometimes meeting five or more days a week, and all of their members consider themselves home educated. In some states, public school districts have developed homeschooling programs in which homeschoolers are considered enrolled in school and have access to school resources and facilities. In addition, the lines between alternative and conventional education are becoming increasingly blurred as many conventional schools incorporate into their overall approach methods that were originally unique to alternative education. International . Canada . In Canada, some private schools also receive public funding. The Toronto District School Board has incorporated alternative programs into its school system. In some cases, such as Mountview Alternative School in Toronto's High Park Junction, the entire school shares a common facility, and in others, it is Canada's only high school program specifically designed for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students, In some cases, it is an in-school program, such as the Triangle program. In others, such as Divine Class, a holistic non-school program that teaches and certifies the general public (ages 18 and up) how to read people, situations, and events using alternative methods such as tarot, psychic abilities, and esoteric systems. The Universal School of Life in Quebec has been in existence for over 23 years and focuses on Indigo children and families, creating a way of life for the Indigo family. The Sands School is an alternative school in the UK. It has only 65 pupils and the teacher ratio is very high. Pupils learn at their own pace in a collaborative atmosphere. The school is democratically run and pupils have as much say as staff in the running of the school. Decisions on everything from a new carpet color to the hiring of new staff are voted on at weekly school assemblies. The school teaches all subjects and attendance at lessons is not compulsory but discussed. It also gives pupils a broader education than other schools, allowing them to choose what to study. Pupils' interests form a large part of the curriculum. Australia Presil in Kew, Australia was founded in the 1930s. It is one of the few alternative schools in Australia that is not affiliated with any doctrinal or theological movement. Elementary school were established by Margaret Little in 1931 and secondary schools have been in operation since the late 1970s. Village School (Vic), Callumban Primary School (NSW), Melbourne Community School (Vic), Collingwood College (Vic), Fitzroy Community School (Vic), See also Linal Hall (Vic), Berengarra, Candlebark School (Vic), Brisbane Independent School (Queensland). Terra Bella Academy in Mountain View, California, USA, is a public alternative school serving grades 8-12. The curriculum is affiliated with Santa Clara University (Santa Clara, California, USA) and includes social dialogue and team building activities. In India, since the early 20th century, many educational theorists have discussed and practiced radically different forms of education. Rabindranath Tagore's Shantiniketan and Mahatma Gandhi's ideal of "basic education" are prime examples of this. Many new alternative schools have emerged in recent years, such as Sarang Parakad Kerala, Adarsila Sarkad MP, Theta School - Bangalore, Kanav, Timbaktu collective Andhra Pradesh. At higher levels of education, one can find learning options like multiversity.com where open knowledge is the ideal. Holistic education, in which the learner's environment is seen as an integral part of the educational process, has been gaining popularity in recent decades. See also.
