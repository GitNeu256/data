Curiosity is a car-sized Mars rover that will explore Gale Crater and Mount Sharp on Mars as part of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. Curiosity launched from Cape Canaveral (CCAFS) on November 26, 2011 at 15:02:00 UTC and landed on August 6, 2012 at 05:17:57 UTC at Aeolis Pulse in Gale Crater on Mars. The Bradbury landing site was less than 2.4 km (1.5 miles) from the center of the target where the rover touched down after a 560 million km (350 million mile) journey.
Mission objectives include a study of the climate and geology of Mars, an assessment of whether selected field sites within Gale have ever provided environmental conditions suitable for microbial life (including an investigation of the role of water), and an investigation of planetary habitability in preparation for human exploration.
In December 2012, Curiosity's two-year mission was extended indefinitely, and on August 5, 2017, NASA celebrated the fifth anniversary of the landing of the Curiosity rover; on August 6, 2022, a detailed summary of results from the Curiosity rover over the past decade was reported. The rover is still operational, and as of December 29, 2023, Curiosity has been active on Mars for 4051 sols (4162 total days, 11 years 145 days) since landing (see Current Status).
The NASA/JPL Mars Science Laboratory/Curiosity project team was awarded the 2012 Robert J. Collier Trophy by the National Aeronautics Society." . for extraordinary achievements in successfully landing Curiosity on Mars, advancing the nation's technological and engineering capabilities, and significantly improving humanity's understanding of the habitable environment of prehistoric Mars." Curiosity's rover design is the basis for NASA's 2021 Perseverance Mission, which will carry different scientific instruments.

As set by the Mars Exploration Program, the primary scientific goals of the MSL mission are to help determine whether Mars could sustain life, determine the role of water, and study the climate and geology of Mars. Mission results will also help prepare for human exploration. To contribute to these goals, MSL has eight primary scientific objectives
Biological
	1. determination of the properties and inventory of organic carbon compounds
	2. investigate the chemical building blocks of life (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur)
	3. identify features that represent the effects of biological processes (biosignatures and biomolecules)
geologic and geochemical
	4. investigate the chemical, isotopic, and mineral composition of geologic materials on and near the surface of Mars
	5. interpret the processes by which rocks and soils were formed and altered
planetary processes
	6. evaluate Martian atmospheric evolutionary processes over long time scales (i.e., 4 billion years)
	7. determine the current state, distribution, and cycling of water and carbon dioxide
surface radiation
	8. characterize the broad spectrum of surface radiation, including galactic radiation, cosmic radiation, solar proton events, and secondary neutrons As part of the exploration, radiation exposure inside the spacecraft traveling to Mars will also be measured, and radiation measurements will continue as the spacecraft explores the Martian surface. This data will be important for future manned missions.
After about a year of surface exploration, MSL's assessment of the possibility that ancient Mars was a hospitable environment for microbial life has evolved into a mission goal to develop predictive models of the preservation processes of organic compounds and biomolecules The area MSL is exploring has been compared to the Four Corners region in western North America. The area to be explored by MSL has been compared to the Four Corners region of western North America.
NAME
The NASA review committee chose the name "Curiosity" after a national student contest that attracted more than 9,000 proposals via the Internet and mail. The winner was 12-year-old Clara Ma, a sixth grader at Sunflower Elementary School in Lenexa, Kansas. As a prize, Ma won a trip to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, where she signed her name in person as the rover was assembled.
Ma wrote in her award essay:
	Curiosity is an eternal flame that burns in everyone's heart. Curiosity is an eternal flame that burns in everyone's heart, and when we get out of bed in the morning, we are excited to see what surprises await us that day. Curiosity is a very powerful force. Without it, we would not be where we are today. Curiosity is the passion that drives our daily lives. We become explorers and scientists by our need to ask questions and wonder.
Cost
The life cycle cost of Curiosity, adjusted for inflation, is US$3.2 billion in 2020 dollars. In contrast, the life cycle cost of the Perseverance rover in 2021 is US$2.9 billion.
Rover and lander specifications
Curiosity is 2.9 m long, 2.7 m wide, and 2.2 m high, larger than the Mars Exploration Rover's 1.5 m length and 174 kg mass (including 6.8 kg of scientific instruments). Compared to the Mars Exploration Rover's Pancam, MastCam-34 has 1.25 times greater spatial resolution and MastCam-100 has 3.67 times greater spatial resolution.
Curiosity carries advanced scientific instruments to Mars; it is the fourth NASA robotic rover sent to Mars since 1996. Previous successful Mars rovers have been Sojourner (1997) on the Mars Pathfinder mission and Spirit (2004-2010) and Opportunity (2004-2018) on the Mars Exploration Rover mission.
At launch, Curiosity accounted for 23% of the spacecraft's mass of 3,893 kg (8,583 lbs). The remaining mass was discarded during the transportation and landing process.
	* Dimensions: Curiosity's mass was 899 kg (1,982 lbs), including 80 kg (180 lbs) of scientific instruments. It is 2.9 m long, 2.7 m wide, and 2.2 m high.
The main box-like enclosure forms the Warm Electronics Box (WEB).
	* Power Curiosity will be powered by a Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG), similar to the successful 1976 Viking 1 and Viking 2 Mars landers.
	  A radioisotope power system (RPS) is a generator that produces electricity from the decay of radioactive isotopes such as plutonium-238. The heat released by the decay of these isotopes is used to generate electricity using thermocouples, providing a stable supply of power regardless of season or day/night. Waste heat is also used to heat the system via pipes, releasing power for vehicle and equipment operation. Curiosity's RTG is fueled by 4.8 kg (11 lbs) of plutonium dioxide-238 supplied by the U.S. Department of Energy.
	  Curiosity's RTG is a multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG), designed and manufactured by Rocketdyne and Teledyne Energy Systems under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy, and fueled and tested by the Idaho National Laboratory. Based on legacy RTG technology, it is a more flexible and compact development step, designed to produce 110 watts of electrical power and approximately 2,000 watts of thermal power at mission startup The MMRTG's power output will decrease as the plutonium fuel decays, so after 14 years, its minimum life the power output will drop to 100 watts. The power source produces 9 MJ (2.5 kWh) of electrical energy per day, far more than the solar panels on the now-retired Mars Exploration Rover, which produce about 2.1 MJ (0.58 kWh) per day. the electrical output from the MMRTG will power two rechargeable lithium ion batteries that recharge the batteries. This allows the power subsystem to meet the peak power demand of rover activity if demand temporarily exceeds the generator's steady-state output level. Each battery has a capacity of approximately 42 amp-hours.
	* Heat removal system Heat removal system: Since the temperature at the landing site varies with the seasons, the thermal system warms the rover as needed. The thermal system can be done in several ways: passively by heat dissipation to internal components, by electric heaters strategically placed in major components, or by using the rover's Heat Removal System (HRS) The HRS is a 60 m (200 ft) in the rover body. fluid pumped through tubing to keep sensitive components at optimal temperatures. This fluid loop also serves the purpose of releasing heat when the rover gets too warm, and can also collect waste heat from the power source by sending fluid through two heat exchangers mounted next to the RTG. The HRS also has the ability to cool components as needed.
	* Computers Two identical rover-mounted computers, called Rover Compute Elements (RCEs), have radiation-hardened memory to withstand extreme radiation from space and protect against power-off cycles. The computers run the VxWorks real-time operating system (RTOS). Each computer's memory includes 256 kilobytes (kB) of EEPROM, 256 megabytes (MB) of dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and 2 gigabytes (GB) of flash memory. For comparison, the Mars Exploration Rover uses 3 MB of EEPROM, 128 MB of DRAM, and 256 MB of flash memory.
	* The RCE computer uses the RAD750 central processing unit (CPU), the successor to Mars Exploration Rover's RAD6000 CPU; the IBM RAD750 CPU is a radiation-hardened version of the PowerPC 750 and runs up to 35 MIPS, whereas the RAD6000 CPU runs only 35 MIPS. One of the two onboard computers is configured as a backup and takes over in case of problems with the main computer. On February 28, 2013, NASA announced that the active computer's flash On February 28, 2013, NASA was forced to switch to the backup computer due to a problem with the active computer's flash memory. The backup computer was turned on in safe mode and then returned to active status on March 4, 2013; a similar problem occurred in late March and full operations resumed on March 25, 2013.
	  The Rover has an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that provides three-axis position information used for navigation of the Rover. The rover's computer constantly monitors itself to keep the rover operational, including regulating the rover's temperature. Activities such as photography, driving, and equipment operation are performed by command sequences sent to the rover by the flight team. After landing, the rover installed complete ground operations software. This new software essentially replaces the flight software.
	  The rover is equipped with four processors. One of them is a SPARC processor, which activates the rover's thrusters and descent stage motors as it descends through the Martian atmosphere. The other two are PowerPC processors, the main processor that handles nearly all of the rover's ground functions and its backup processor. the fourth, another SPARC processor, commands the rover's movements and is part of the motor controller box. all four processors are all single-core.
COMMUNICATIONS
	* Communications: Curiosity has significant telecommunications redundancy through several means: an X-band transmitter and receiver for direct communications with Earth and a very high frequency (UHF) electralight software-defined radio for communications with the Mars orbiter. Communication with the orbiter is the primary pathway for data return to Earth. This is because orbiters have more power and larger antennas than landers, allowing for faster transmission rates. Communications will include a small deep-space transponder on the descent stage and a solid-state power amplifier for the rover's X-band. The rover is also equipped with two UHF radios that can relay signals from an orbiting relay satellite to Earth. Signals between Earth and Mars take an average of 14 minutes and 6 seconds. Curiosity can communicate directly with Earth at speeds of up to 32 kbit/s, but the bulk of the data transfer is relayed through the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Odyssey Orbiter. Data transfer rates between Curiosity and each orbiter may reach 2000 kbit/s and 256 kbit/s, respectively, but each orbiter can communicate with Curiosity for only about 8 minutes per day (0.56% of time). Communication with Curiosity relies on internationally agreed space data communication protocols defined by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems.
	  The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is the central data distribution hub, and selected data products are provided to remote science operations sites as needed; JPL is also the central hub for the uplink process, but participants are distributed among their respective affiliations. Upon landing, telemetry was monitored by three orbiters, the 2001 Mars Odyssey, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and ESA's Mars Express satellite, depending on their dynamic locations. As of February 2019, the MAVEN orbiter will continue its science mission while relaying positioned to serve as an orbiter.
Mobility System
	* Mobility system: Curiosity is equipped with six 50 cm (20-inch) diameter wheels with rocker bogie suspension. This is a scaled-down version of that used on the Mars Exploration Rover (MER). Unlike its smaller predecessor, this suspension system also serves as a landing gear. Each wheel has cleats that operate independently and are geared so they can climb soft sand or scramble over rocks. The front and rear wheels can be steered independently and can turn on the spot or arc around. Each wheel has a pattern, which not only helps maintain traction, but also leaves a pattern of footprints on the surface of the Martian sand. This pattern is used by the on-board camera to estimate the distance traveled. The pattern itself is in "JPL" Morse code (--- ---- ---- ----). The rover can climb dunes with slopes up to 12.5°. Based on its center of gravity, it can withstand a tilt of at least 50° in any direction without overturning, but automatic sensors limit tilt beyond 30° After six years of use, the wheels are visibly worn with punctures and tears.
Curiosity can roll over obstacles as close as 65 cm (26 inches) high and has a ground clearance of 60 cm (24 inches). Based on variables such as power level, terrain difficulty, slip, and visibility, the maximum terrain crossing speed with automatic navigation is estimated at 200 meters (660 feet) per day. The rover is expected to land approximately 10 km from the base of Mount Sharp and traverse a minimum of 19 km (12 miles) during its two-year primary mission. It can travel up to 90 meters (300 feet) per hour, but its average speed is about 30 meters (98 feet) per hour. The rover will be "driven" by several operators led by Vandi Verma, group leader of JPL's Autonomous Systems, Mobility and Robotic Systems.
Landing.
Curiosity landed on Quad 51 (nicknamed Yellowknife) at Aeolis Pulse in Crater Gale. The coordinates of the landing site are 4.5895°S 137.4417°E. The site was named Bradbury Landing on August 22, 2012, after science fiction author Ray Bradbury. Gale is estimated to be a 3.5- to 3.8-billion-year-old impact crater, first deposited by water, then by wind, and probably gradually filled by sediments until it was completely covered. Later, wind erosion scraped away the sediments, leaving an isolated 5.5-km (3.4-mile) mountain, Aeolis Mons ("Mount Sharp"), at the center of the 154-km (96-mile)-wide crater. It is therefore believed that the probe may be able to investigate 2 billion years of Martian history from the sediments exposed on this mountain. It is further hypothesized that the landing site is near an alluvial fan and is the result of groundwater flow that occurred either before eroded sediments were deposited or in the relatively recent geologic history of the planet.
According to NASA, an estimated 20,000 to 40,000 heat-resistant bacterial spores were on Curiosity at launch, and as many as 1,000 times that number may have been uncounted.
The rover's landing system
Previous NASA Mars rovers have been active only after successfully entering, descending, and landing on Mars. Curiosity, on the other hand, was active from the time it landed on the Martian surface, employing a rover suspension system for final set-down.
As soon as Curiosity transformed from its stowed flight form to its landing form, the MSL rover was lowered by a 20-meter (66-foot) tether from the "sky crane" system to the bottom of the rover's descent stage for a soft landing on the Martian surface. After landing, the rover waited for 2 seconds to confirm that it was on solid ground, then fired several pyrotechnic fasteners, activated the bridle's cable cutters, and released itself from the rover descent stage. The descent stage then flew away for a crash landing and the rover was ready to begin the science portion of the mission.
Voyage Status
As of December 9, 2020, the rover was 23.32 km (14.49 mi) from the landing site; as of April 17, 2020, the rover had traveled less than 800 days out of 2736 sols (Mars days); as of May 30, 2023, the rover had traveled 30.00 km (18.64 mi) km (18.64 mi) traveled.
REPLICATIONS.
Curiosity has two full-size Vehicle System Test Beds (VSTBs), twin rovers used for testing and problem solving, a MAGGIE rover (Mars Automated Giant Gizmo for Integrated Engineering) and a Scarecrow Rover without a computer brain. These will be housed at the JPL Mars Yard and used to solve problems in simulated Martian terrain.
Scientific Instruments
The general sample analysis strategy begins with a high-resolution camera looking for features of interest. If a particular surface is of interest, Curiosity can use an infrared laser to vaporize a portion of that surface and examine the resulting spectral signature to determine the elemental composition of the rock. If the signature is intriguing, the rover will use its long arm to wield a microscope and an X-ray spectrometer to examine it in detail. If further analysis is required, Curiosity can drill holes in the rock and send powdered samples to the rover's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) or CheMin analysis labs: MastCam, Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI), Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) cameras were developed by Malin Space Science Systems and share the same design and components, including an on-board digital image processing box, a 1600 x 1200 charge-coupled device (CCD), and RGB Bayer pattern filters. components.
The rover is equipped with a total of 17 cameras: HazCam, NavCam, MastCam, MAHLI, MARDI, and ChemCam.
MastCam (Mast Camera)
The MastCam system provides multiple spectral and true color imaging with two cameras. The cameras can capture 1600 x 1200 pixel true color images and 720p (1280 x 720) hardware compressed video (up to 10 frames per second).
One of the MastCam cameras is a medium-angle camera (MAC) with a 34 mm focal length, 15° field of view, and a scale of 22 cm/pixel (8.7 inches/pixel) at 1 km (0.62 miles). It has a focal length of 100 mm, a field of view of 5.1°, and a range of 7.4 cm/pixel (2.9 inches/pixel) at 1 km. Marin also developed a mast cam with a zoom lens, but due to the time needed to test the new hardware and the imminent launch in November 2011, it was not installed on the rover. However, an improved zoom version will be included on the Mars 2020 mission as Mastcam Z.
Each camera has 8 gigabytes of flash memory and can store more than 5,500 raw images and apply lossless data compression in real time. The camera has an autofocus feature that can focus on objects from 2.1 meters (6 feet 11 inches) to infinity. In addition to a fixed RGBG Bayer pattern filter, each camera has an 8-position filter wheel. Although the Bayer filters reduce the throughput of visible light, all three colors are mostly transparent at wavelengths longer than 700 nm, thus having minimal impact on such infrared observations.
Chemistry and Camera Complex (ChemCam)
ChemCam combines two remote sensing instruments, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and remote microimager (RMI), into one. the ChemCam instrument suite was developed by the CESR laboratory in France and the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The flight model of the mast unit was delivered to Los Alamos National Laboratory from CNES, France The purpose of the LIBS instrument is to provide elemental composition of rocks and soils, and the RMI will provide ChemCam scientists with high-resolution images of the sampled areas of rock and soil targeted by the LIBS. The LIBS instrument targets rock and soil samples up to 7 meters (23 feet) away, vaporizes a small sample with approximately 50-75 5-nanosecond pulses from a 1067-nm infrared laser, and allows observation of the light spectrum emitted from the vaporized rock.
ChemCam has the ability to record up to 6,144 different wavelengths of ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light. Detection of the luminous plasma sphere is in the visible, near-ultraviolet, and near-infrared ranges, between 240 nm and 800 nm. The first laser test of ChemCam by Curiosity on Mars was performed on August 19, 2012 on a rock called N165 ("crowning" rock) near Bradbury Landing; the ChemCam team plans to measure the composition of about 12 rocks per day. Using the same acquisition optics, the RMI will provide a contextual image of the LIBS analysis spot; the RMI will resolve a 1 mm (0.039 inch) object at a distance of 10 m (33 feet), with a field of view covering 20 cm (7.9 inches) at that distance.
Navigation Camera (Navcam)
Rover has two pairs of black-and-white navigation cameras mounted on the mast to assist with ground navigation. The cameras have a 45° angle of view and use visible light to capture three-dimensional 3D images.
Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS)
REMS consists of instruments that measure the Martian environment (humidity, pressure, temperature, wind speed, and ultraviolet radiation). It is a meteorological package including UV sensors provided by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science. The research team was led by Javier Gomez Elvira of the Spanish Center for Astrobiology, with the Finnish Meteorological Institute as a partner. All sensors are installed around three elements: two booms attached to the rover's mast, an ultraviolet sensor (UVS) assembly on the rover's top deck, and an instrument control unit (ICU) in the rover's main body.REMS is based on the interaction between the ground and the atmosphere, the Mars s general circulation, micro-scale weather systems, local water cycle, UV destructibility, and new clues about subsurface habitability.
Hazard Avoidance Camera (Hazcam)
The rover is equipped with four sets of black-and-white navigation cameras called Hazcam, two sets in the front and two sets in the rear. These are used for autonomous hazard avoidance during rover travel and for safe positioning of the robotic arm over rocks and soil. Each camera in a pair is hard-linked to one of two identical main computers for redundancy. The cameras use visible light to capture three-dimensional (3D) images. The camera has a 120° field of view and maps the terrain up to 3 meters (9.8 feet) in front of the rover. This image is linked to software that prevents the rover from colliding with unexpected obstacles and allows the rover to make its own safety choices.
Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI)
The MAHLI is a camera mounted on the Mars rover's robotic arm to acquire microscopic images of rocks and soil The MAHLI is capable of capturing true-color images with a resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels, or 14.5 μm per pixel The MAHLI's focal length is 18.3 to 21.3 mm (0.72 to 0.84 inches) and a viewing angle of 33.8 to 38.5°. MAHLI features both white and ultraviolet light-emitting diode (LED) illumination for imaging in the dark and fluorescence imaging. MAHLI also features mechanical focus adjustment from infinity to millimeter distance. The system can produce several images with the focus stacking process. the MAHLI can store raw images or perform real-time lossless predictive or JPEG compression. the MAHLI's calibration targets include a color reference. the MAHLI's calibration targets include a color reference, metric bar graphics, 1909 VDB Lincoln pennies, and staircase patterns for depth calibration.
Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS)
The APXS is an instrument that irradiates a sample with alpha particles and measures the elemental composition of the sample by mapping the spectrum of the re-emitted X-rays. Curiosity's APXS was developed by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). McDonald Detweiler (MDA), the Canadian aerospace company that built the Canadian Arm and RADARSAT, was responsible for the engineering design and manufacturing of APXS. the APXS science team includes the University of Guelph, the University of New Brunswick, the University of Western ontario, NASA, the University of California, San Diego, and Cornell University.The APXS instrument utilizes particle-induced x-ray emission (PIXE) and fluorescent x-rays utilized by the Mars Pathfinder and two Mars Exploration Rovers.
Chemical Mineralogy (CheMin)
CheMin is a chemical mineralogy X-ray powder diffraction and fluorescence instrument CheMin is one of four spectrometers. It can identify and quantify Martian minerals; it was developed by David Blake of NASA's Ames Research Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and received the 2013 NASA Government Invention Award. The rover takes samples from rocks, and the resulting fine powder is poured into the instrument through a sample injection tube at the top of the rover. An x-ray beam is then irradiated onto the powder, deflecting the x-rays at an angle characteristic of the mineral's crystalline structure, allowing scientists to identify the mineral to be analyzed.
On October 17, 2012, the first X-ray diffraction analysis of Martian soil was performed at the "Rock Nest". The results revealed the presence of several minerals, including feldspar, pyroxene, and olivine, suggesting that the Martian soil in the sample resembles the "weathered basaltic soil" of a Hawaiian volcano. Paragon tephra mined from Hawaiian cinder cone hills has been mined since 1998 to make Martian regolith simulants used by researchers.
Sample Analysis of Mars (SAM)
The SAM suite of instruments analyzes organic matter and gases from both atmospheric and solid samples, and is operated by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, LISA (Laboratoire Inter-Universitaire des Systèmes Atmosphériques) (CNRS in France and the Paris It is composed of equipment developed by LISA (jointly run by CNRS and the University of Paris) and Honeybee Robotics, as well as a number of external partners. The three main instruments are a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS), a gas chromatograph (GC), and a tunable laser spectrometer (TLS). These instruments precisely measure the oxygen and carbon isotope ratios of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in the Martian atmosphere and distinguish between geochemical or biological origins.
Dust Removal Tool (DRT)
The Dust Removal Tool (DRT) is a motor-driven wire brush attached to a turret at the end of Curiosity's arm. the DRT was first used on January 6, 2013 on a rock target named Ekwir_1. the DRT was developed by Honeybee Robotics, Inc. Manufactured by. Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD)
The role of the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) is to assess the spectrum of the extensive radiation environment found inside spacecraft during cruise and Mars stays. Such measurements have never been made from inside a spacecraft in interplanetary space. The primary objectives are to determine the feasibility of human exploration and the need for shielding, and to characterize the radiation environment on the surface of Mars, which has been done since shortly after MSL's landing in August 2012. with funding from the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters and the German Space Agency (DLR), RAD has been working with the Southwest Research Institute ( SwRI) and the Extraterrestrial Physics Group of the Christian Albrechts-University Kiel, Germany.
Neutron Dynamic Albedo (DAN)
The DAN instrument employs a neutron source and detector to measure the amount and depth of hydrogen or ice and water on or near the Martian surface. The instrument consists of a detector element (DE) and a 14.1 MeV pulsed neutron generator (PNG). The neutron die-away time is measured by the DE after each neutron pulse from the PNG; the DAN is provided by the Russian Federal Space Agency and funded by Russia.
Mars Descent Device (MARDI)
MARDI is fixed to the front lower left of Curiosity's main body. During its descent to the surface of Mars, MARDI captured 1600 x 1200 pixel color images at a rate of 4 frames per second for approximately 2 minutes with an exposure time of 1.3 ms from a distance of about 3.7 km (2.3 miles) to about 5 m (16 feet) from the ground. MARDI has an internal buffer memory of 8 gigabytes and can store over 4,000 raw images, enabled mapping of the surrounding terrain and landing sites. JunoCam, built for the Juno spacecraft, is based on MARDI.
Robotic arm
The rover has a 2.1 m (6 ft. 11 in.) long robotic arm with five devices mounted on cross-shaped turrets. The arm extends forward using three joints and retracts again during travel. It has a mass of 30 kg (66 lbs.) and a diameter of approximately 60 cm (24 inches), including the mounted tools. It was designed, built, and tested by MDA US Systems, Inc. and is based on the robotic arm's work on the Mars Surveyor 2001 lander, the Phoenix lander, and two Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity.
Two of the five instruments are in-situ or contact instruments called the X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI camera). The remaining three are related to sampling and sample preparation functions: percussion drills, brushes, and mechanisms for scooping, sieving, and subdividing powdered rock and soil samples. After drilling, the rock pit is up to 1.6 cm (0.63") in diameter and 5 cm (2.0") deep. The drill is equipped with two spare bits. The rover's arm and turret system can place APXS and MAHLI on their respective targets, as well as collect powder samples from inside the rock and deliver them to the SAM and CheMin analyzers in the rover.
Since early 2015, the striking mechanism of the drill that chisels into the rock had been experiencing intermittent electrical shorts; on December 1, 2016, the motor inside the drill malfunctioned, preventing the rover from moving the robotic arm to drive to another location. The malfunction was isolated to the drill's feed brake and internal debris was suspected to be the cause of the problem; by December 9, 2016, driving and robotic arm operation could continue, but drilling remained suspended indefinitely. The Curiosity team continued diagnostics and testing of the drill mechanism throughout 2017 and resumed drilling operations on May 22, 2018.
Media, Cultural Impact and Legacy
At midnight PDT on August 6, 2012, live video showing the first images from the surface of Mars was released on NASA TV. In addition, a 13-minute video excerpt of the landing published on NASA's YouTube channel was shut down by an automatic DMCA removal notice from Scripps Local News an hour after the landing, making it inaccessible for several hours. About 1,000 people gathered in New York's Times Square to watch NASA's live coverage of the Curiosity landing on a giant screen. Bobak Ferdowsi, the flight director who was in charge of the landing, became an Internet meme due to the mohawk with yellow stars he wore during the telecast, and his Twitter account gained 45,000 new followers and Twitter celebrity status. celebrity status on Twitter.
On August 13, 2012, U.S. President Barack Obama called from Air Force One to congratulate the Curiosity team and said, "You are an example of American know-how and ingenuity. It is truly a great accomplishment."
Scientists at the Getty Conservation Institute in Los Angeles, California, see the CheMin device on Curiosity as a potentially valuable means of inspecting ancient works of art without damaging them. Until recently, there were only a limited number of instruments that could determine the composition of artifacts without having to cut out samples large enough to potentially damage them; CheMin determines the composition of artifacts in a matter of minutes by bombarding particles as small as 400 μm (0.016 inches) with a beam of X-rays and reading the radiation that scatters back. Engineers have developed a smaller, portable version, dubbed the X-Duetto. The X-Duetto, which fits into a briefcase the size of several briefcases, can examine artifacts in the field while preserving the physical integrity of the artifacts. It is currently being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum antiquities and the Roman ruins at Herculaneum, Italy.
Prior to the landing, NASA and Microsoft released the game "Mars Rover Landing," available for free download on Xbox Live.
From 2009 to 2011, NASA solicited names from the public to send to Mars. More than 1.2 million people from the international community participated, and their names were etched into silicon using an electron beam device used to manufacture microdevices at JPL. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. Curiosity's namesake, Clara Ma, a 12-year-old girl from Kansas, wrote in an essay, "Curiosity is the passion that drives our daily lives."
On August 6, 2013, Curiosity performed "Happy Birthday to You" to mark the one-year anniversary of its landing on Mars. This was also the first instance of music being transmitted between the two planets.
On June 24, 2014, Curiosity achieved one Martian year (687 Earth days) after discovering that Mars once had favorable environmental conditions for microbial life. Curiosity was the basis for the design of the Perseverance rover, which will be used on the 2020 mission to Mars. The new rover will use some spare parts from Curiosity's manufacturing and ground testing, but will carry different instruments.
