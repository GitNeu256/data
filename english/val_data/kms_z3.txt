Z3 Max Schulze was one of four Type 1934 destroyers built for the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) in the mid-1930s. Completed in 1937, two years before the start of World War II, she spent most of her time in training, although she did participate in the operation to occupy Memel in early 1939. Shortly before the outbreak of World War II, she was accidentally hit by a German torpedo boat and sunk; Z3 Max Schulze spent the next month making repairs; in mid-February 1940, while heading into the North Sea to search for British fishing boats, one of her sisters, Z1 Leberecht Maass, was hit by German bombers on patrol and sank. The ship sank with the loss of 280 crew members. Z3 Max Schulze, attempting to rescue survivors, was either bombed by German bombers on patrol or hit by a British mine and sank, killing all 308 crew members. A contemporaneous German court-martial had stated that Z3 Max Schultz had been damaged by German bombers, but postwar research revealed that Z3 Max Schultz may have struck a mine instead.
Design and Description
Design work on the Type 34 destroyer began in 1932, around the time Weimar Germany abandoned the arms restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I. The original design envisioned a larger ship, more powerful than the French and Polish destroyers in service at the time, but the design was expanded as the Kriegsmarine came to be expected to serve as a small cruiser. The design appears to have been rushed, and the short bow foremast and lack of flares compromised the ship's seaworthiness and made it inadequately stable. The only innovation in the design, the high-pressure water tube boiler, was an overly complex system that was rarely tested on board before being installed on the Type 34 and frequently failed throughout the ship's life.
The ship was 119 meters long with a draft line length of 114 meters. The beam was 11.30 meters (37 feet 1 inch) and the maximum draft was 4.23 meters (13 feet 11 inches). Two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, used steam supplied by six Wagner boilers to produce 70,000 PS (51, 000 kW; 69,000 shp). The design speed was 36 knots (36 mph). The design speed was 36 knots (67 km/h), but maximum speed was 38.7 knots (71.7 km/h).Type 34 could carry up to 752 tons (740 t) of fuel oil and cruise 4,400 nautical miles (8,100 km; 5,100 miles) at 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph). She was intended to have a range of 4,400 nautical miles (8,100 km, 5,100 miles) at 19 knots (35 km/h, 22 mph), but she proved to be top heavy when commissioned, and 30% of her fuel had to be held as ballast low in the ship's hold. Effective range was found to be only 1,530 nautical miles (2,830 km; 1,760 miles) at 19 knots, and the Type 34 class crew consisted of 10 officers and 315 petty officers, with an additional four officers and 19 petty officers when serving as fleet flagships.
The Type 34 class carried five 12.7cm SK C/34 guns mounted on single gun mounts with gun shields, two each stacked fore and aft; the fifth gun was mounted on top of the aft superstructure. The guns were numbered from one to five from fore to aft. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C/30 guns mounted on a pair of double gun mounts next to the rear funnel and six 2 cm C/30 guns mounted on a single gun mount. Aft of the funnel, to port and starboard, were eight 53.3 cm torpedo tubes mounted on two powered racks. Each rack was equipped with a pair of loaded torpedoes.Z2 Georg Thiele carried four depth charge launchers on the sides above the aft deck, plus six depth charge racks on the aft sides, carrying 32 or 64 charges. The aft deck could be fitted with mine rails that could carry up to 60 mines. A system of passive hydrophones named "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) was equipped to detect submarines.
Construction and Career
The ship was ordered on July 7, 1934 and broken ground on January 2, 1935 at Deutsche Werke in Kiel as yard number K244; she was launched on November 30, 1935 and completed on April 8, 1937. The ship was named after Max Schulze, who commanded torpedo boat V69 and was killed in action in January 1917. Korvettenkapitän Martin Balzer was appointed as the first captain. z3 Max Schulze was assigned to the 1st Destroyer Division on October 26, 1937, and called at Ulvik, Norway, in April 1938 with her sisters z2 Georg Thiele and z4 Richard Beitzen. After returning to Norway, the ship made a port call at Werwick, Germany. After returning to port, she was taken over by the German company Werke and her bow was modified to reduce the amount of water coming over the bow during headwinds. This increased her length by 0.3 meters. In December, Max Schulze, together with his sisters Z1 Leberecht Maas, Z2 Georg Thiele, and Z4 Richard Beitzen, sailed to Iceland to evaluate the new bow's seaworthiness in the North Atlantic winter. On March 23-24, 1939, she was one of the destroyers escorting Adolf Hitler aboard the pocket battleship Deutschland for the occupation of Memel. As flagship of Rear Admiral Günther Lützens, she participated in the spring fleet exercises in the western Mediterranean and made several visits to Spanish and Moroccan ports in April and May.
In the early morning of August 27, 1939, a few days before the outbreak of World War II, the destroyer collided with the torpedo boat Tiger near Bornholm, accidentally sinking it. Two men were killed and six wounded in the torpedo boat, but none were injured in the Z3 Max Schulze. The torpedo boat Tiger was towed aft by Z2 Georg Thiele, whose bow was badly damaged. 30 minutes later, two tugboats arrived and took over the tow to Svinemünde at a speed of 4 knots (7.4 km/h). It did not participate in the Polish campaign.
During October, the ship patrolled Skagerrak to inspect contraband; on October 28, while returning from one such patrol, one of the ship's turbines exploded, flooding the first boiler room and stopping power to the ship. Attempts to tow the ship were unsuccessful, but the ship eventually managed to regain power and sailed to Kiel for repairs. Max Schulze, Beitzen, and Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt laid 110 magnetic mines in shipwash waters off Harwich on February 9 and 10, 1940, sinking six ships of 28,496 gross tons (GRT) and damaging another.
On February 22, Z3 Max Schulz and five destroyers, Z1 Leberecht Maas, Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z6 Theodor Riedel, Z13 Erich Kellner, and Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, sailed to the Dogger Bank to intercept British fishing boats in "Operation Vikinger. Operation Wikinger" to intercept British fishing boats. En route, the convoy was attacked by Heinkel He111 bombers of Bomber Command (Kampfgeschwader) 26; Z1 Leberecht Maass was hit by at least one bomb, lost steering, split in half, and sank with the loss of 280 crew members. During the rescue operation, Z3 Max Schulze struck a mine and sank with the loss of all 308 crew members. Hitler ordered the convening of a commission of inquiry to determine the cause, which concluded that both ships were sunk by He 111 bombs. The German Navy did not inform the destroyers that the Luftwaffe was conducting anti-ship patrols at the time, nor did they inform the Luftwaffe that the destroyers were at sea. Postwar investigations revealed that one or two ships had struck a British minefield laid by the destroyers Ivanhoe and Intrepid.
