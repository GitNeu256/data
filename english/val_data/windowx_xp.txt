Windows XP is a family of dedicated operating systems developed by Microsoft for use in general-purpose computer systems, including home and business desktops, laptops, and media centers. "XP" stands for "eXPerience". Codenamed "Whistler" after Whistler, British Columbia, where many Microsoft employees enjoyed skiing at the Whistler Blackcomb ski resort during its development, Windows XP is the successor to both Windows 2000 and Windows Me and was the first consumer operating system by Microsoft built on the Windows NT kernel and architecture. Windows XP was first released on October 25, 2001, and according to January 2006 estimates by IDC analysts, over 400 million units are in use; it was released to volume license customers on November 8, 2006, and to the general public worldwide on January 30, 2007 Windows Vista has succeeded it.
The most common editions of the operating system are Windows XP Home Edition, which targets home users, and Windows XP Professional, which has additional features such as Windows Server domains and dual processor support and targets power users and business clients Windows XP Media Center Edition adds multimedia features that enhance the ability to record and watch TV programs, watch DVD movies, and listen to music. Tablet PC Edition is designed to run the ink-aware Tablet PC platform; Windows XP 64-bit Edition for IA-64 (Itanium) processors and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition.
Windows XP is known for its improved stability and efficiency over previous versions of Microsoft Windows. It has a significantly redesigned graphical user interface, which Microsoft touts as more user-friendly than previous versions of Windows. New software management features have been introduced, avoiding the "DLL hell" that plagued previous versions of Windows. It was also the first Windows version to use product activation to combat software piracy, a restriction that was unpopular with some users and privacy advocates. Windows XP has also been criticized by some users for its security vulnerabilities, tight integration of applications such as Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player, and user interface.
Windows XP had been in development since early 1999, when Microsoft began work on Windows Neptune, an operating system intended to be the "home edition" equivalent of Windows 2000 Professional. This was eventually cancelled and became Whistler and later Windows XP. Many ideas from Neptune and Odyssey (also a cancelled version of Windows) were used in Windows XP.
