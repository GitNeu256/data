Motability customers have two good reasons to take a closer look at Volkswagen’s range of vehicles, thanks to the manufacturer achieving a commended award for its work with Motability Operations (the company that manages the Motability Car Scheme and the Motability Powered Wheelchair and Scooter Scheme) as well as low Advance Payment terms on a number of popular models including the Golf. The commended accolade is part of the annual Motability Supplier Awards, now in their seventh year, and recognises Volkswagen’s excellence, efficiency, innovation and exceptional customer service. Commenting on the commendation, Mike Betts, chief executive, Motability Operations, said: ‘Offering stable pricing for customers, and popular models at very affordable rates, Volkswagen is highly committed to the Motability Scheme. The commended accolade at the Motability Supplier Awards acknowledges the efforts that have gone into increased environmentally friendly options, better value and an engaged dealer network. Well done to all at Volkswagen.’ A wide range of Volkswagen models is available through the Motability scheme from the new up! city car, through the Polo, Golf – including the Golf Plus, Golf Estate and Cabriolet – Jetta, Passat, Scirocco and Tiguan to the Touran and Sharan people carriers. Many are available with low Advance Payment offers, for example, £99 for the Golf S, and zero Advance Payment on the Polo S and Match models. Commenting on the commendation, head of Volkswagen Fleet Services, Vince Kinner, said: ‘We’re delighted to receive this award and proud that we have been recognised as people who are committed to Motability, both through the products we are able to offer and the service and back-up we provide both internally and through our Retailer network.’ Motability Operations manages the worry-free Motability Scheme for over 600,000 disabled people and their families. Anyone who receives the Higher Rate Mobility Component of the Disability Living Allowance or the War Pensioners’ Mobility Supplement can exchange this monthly payment to lease a brand new car, scooter or powered wheelchair through the Motability Scheme.
