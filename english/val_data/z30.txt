Z30 was one of 15 Type 1936A destroyers built for the German Navy during World War II. completed in 1941, she was transferred to Norwegian waters in early 1942, where she was engaged in escorting convoys and laying minefields. in September 1943, she was damaged in an air raid on Spitsbergen Island. Z30 was damaged in an air raid on Spitsbergen Island in September 1943.
Z30 was decommissioned at the end of 1944 after striking a mine, and the rest of the war was spent repairing her. After the war, she was transferred to the United Kingdom, who used her to test the effects of underwater explosions; after her completion in 1948, Z30 was scrapped for scrap.
Design and Description
The Type 1936A destroyer was slightly larger and heavier armed than the preceding Type 1936 class. Its overall length was 127 meters (416 feet 8 inches) and its length at the draft line was 121.9 meters (399 feet 11 inches). The beam was 12 meters (39 feet 4 inches) and the maximum draft was 4.62 meters (15 feet 2 inches). Two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, used steam supplied by six Wagner water tube boilers to produce 70,000 PS ( The Z30 was loaded with enough fuel oil to make 2,950 nautical miles (5,460 km; 3,390 miles) at 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph). The ship was loaded with fuel oil. The crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors.
She was armed with one 15 cm TbtsK C/36 cannon forward of the superstructure and three aft. Antiaircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm C/30 guns mounted on two mounts next to the rear funnel and five 2 cm C/30 guns on a single mount; Z30 carried eight overwater 53.3 cm torpedo tubes on two powered mounts. Two reloads were provided on each mount. She was also equipped with a mine track on the aft deck that could carry up to 60 mines. A "GHG" (Gruppenhorchgerät) passive hydrophone was fitted to detect submarines and probably also S-Gerät sonar. The upper bridge was equipped with a FuMO 24/25 radar.
Alterations.
Between 1942 and 1943, Z30's anti-aircraft armament was increased to 10 each of 3.7 cm and 2 cm guns; between 1944 and 1945, the aft searchlight was replaced by a FuMO 63 Hohenziel radar. At the end of the war, the anti-aircraft armament was increased to seven 3.7 cm and 14 2 cm guns.
History of service
Z30 was ordered from AG Weser (Deschimag) on April 23, 1938; she was broken ground on January 14, 1940 at the Bremen shipyard in Deschimag under yard number W964, launched on August 12, and commissioned on November 15, 1941; on January 14, 1942, while at work, she collided with German submarine U -216 collided with the German submarine U-216.
From 18 March, she escorted the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper from Brunsbüttel, Germany, to Trondheim, Norway, and the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer from Trondheim to Narvik, Z30 attempted to intercept Convoy PQ17 in July It took part in the outposts of Operation Rösselsprung. At Narvik, Admiral Scheier and the Lützow sisters formed one group with Z30 and her four sisters, while the battleship Tirpitz and Admiral Hipper formed another group. En route to the rendezvous at Alta Fjord, three destroyers escorting Lützow and Tirpitz ran aground, forcing the entire group to abandon the operation; between September 5 and 8, Z30, her sister ship Z29, and destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen sailed to the islands of Novaya Zemlya and laid a minefield in the Kara Strait between the islands of Novaya Zemlya and Weigach. Then, from September 24-28, Admiral Hipper, along with her sisters Z23, Z28, and Z29, participated in Operation Zarin, a minesweeping operation off Novaya Zemlya. Between October 13 and 15, Z30, her sister ships Z27 and Z4 Richard Beitzen, and destroyer Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt laid a minefield off the Kanin Peninsula in the White Sea Estuary and sank the Soviet icebreaker Mikoyan. Three weeks later, the same four destroyers escorted Admiral Hipper as he attempted to intercept an Allied merchant ship heading alone into a Soviet port in early November. They intercepted and sunk the westbound Soviet oil tanker Donbass and the submarine chaser BO-78 on the 7th.
On December 30, Lützow and Admiral Hipper, escorted by six destroyers, including Z30, departed Narvik for Operation Regenbogen. Admiral Hipper and three destroyers planned to attack the convoys from the north and draw off the escorts; Lützow, Z30, and destroyers Z6 Theodor Riedel and Z31 attacked the undefended convoys from the south. The Germans engaged the convoy briefly, damaging only one merchant ship, but were unable to press their attack, and Z30 became one of the escorts for the light cruiser Cologne and the damaged Admiral Hipper on January 24, 1943, sailing to Kiel, Germany, where the destroyers would begin their refit.
After refit, she returned to Norwegian waters and conducted several minesweeping missions with Z27 from 19-28 June; in September, she participated in Operation Jitronella, the German raid on Spitsbergen Island, where she was slightly damaged by coastal bombardment; Z30 was one of the escorts of the battleship Scharnhorst in Operation Ostfront on 25 December. Z30 was one of the escorts of the battleship Scharnhorst in Operation Ostfront on December 25, and attempted to intercept the British convoy JW 55B en route to the Soviet Union. All escorts of the battleship Scharnhorst were detached the next day to increase the possibility of intercepting the convoy and did not participate in the subsequent Battle of the North Cape; transferred to southern Norway in 1944 and from 8 May escorted and mined convoys; began refit work at Svinemünde, Germany on 31 August; on 31 August, she was ordered to the Baltic Sea and to the Baltic Sea, and on 31 December she was ordered to the Baltic Sea, On October 20, while escorting a convoy, Z30 struck a mine off the Oslofjord and was disabled. The explosion destroyed the stern compartment, shut down the port turbine, jammed the starboard propeller shaft, and severely impacted the entire ship. She was towed to Oslo, Norway, for repairs, but repairs were not yet complete when Germany surrendered on May 8, 1945, and she was decommissioned six days later.
Z30 was turned over to the Norwegian Navy on July 15, while the Allies decided how to divide the remaining German naval vessels as war reparations; she was assigned to the British in late 1945 and towed to Rosyth, Scotland, on February 6, 1946. Virtually unusable without extensive - and expensive - repairs, it was to be used to assess the effects of underwater explosions on the hull Z30 was towed to Loch Striven and tested from May to September 1948. 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of Three 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) torpex explosives were detonated at various depths under the hull. The welded hull was not severely damaged, although there was some damage to the hull plating. The vessel was sold for scrap on September 9 and towed to the Dalmuir facility for dismantling.
